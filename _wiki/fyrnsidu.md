title: Fyrnsidu
---

**Fyrnsidu** is a modern religion based upon what is known about the religion of the pre-Christian Anglo-Saxons. The word is a neologism combining two Old English words: *fyrn* (*ancient, old*) and *sidu* (*custom, use, manner, habit, practice*). It is also known as Anglo-Saxon Heathenry. One who practices Fyrnsidu is called a Fyrnsidere (plural: Fyrnsideras). 

Fyrnsidu is a polytheistic religion and is animistic. Ancestors also tend to be highly honoured among Fyrnsideras. Fyrnsidish practice can vary, but tends to center around building relationships with one's ancestors, local wights, and gods through reciprocity.
