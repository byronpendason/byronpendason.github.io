title: Hrethe

Hrethe (Old English: *Hreðe*, Latin: *Rheda*) is an Anglo-Saxon goddess mentioned by the Venerable Bede in his *On the Reckoning of Time*. The Anglo-Saxon month that corresponds to March was named after her.

Hrethe's name is derived from the Old English word *hreþ*, which means *glory, fame, triumph, honour*[^1]. Based upon the etymology of her name and the placement of her month, most modern reconstructions of her feature her as a goddess associated with victory and the springtime/end of winter[^2].
