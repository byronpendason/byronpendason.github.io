If you'd like to help contribute to the Fyrnsidu Wiki,
there are a couple ways to do it. If an article already exists,
feel free to contribute more info to that article by submitting
the info to the *Talk* page for that article.

If you'd like to contribute an article that doesn't exist yet,
write it out in a Markdown file with the name `name.md` (all
lowercase letters for the name). Follow the following guidelines:

- Do not use first level headers (h1, represented in Markdown as
a single hash at the beginning of a line).

- If you wish to use subheadings, use h2 (##) and h3 (###).

- All articles must be a minimum of two paragraphs 

- Please cite your sources using footnotes.

- Files should start with 3 dashes, `title: Title`, and 3 more dashes on three separate lines.
It should look like this:
    ```
    ---
    title: Title of article
    ---
    
    Start writing your article here.
    ```

You can email article submissions to the editor at [byronpendason@minewyrtruman.com](mailto:byronpendason@minewyrtruman).
