# [The Thyrs Army](/meadhall)

An interactive fiction game written by **Byron Pendason**.

*Version 0.1*

"A thyrs is a lonely fen dweller!" the town's theign declares, "How can there be an army of them laying siege to our town?!"

The priest looks thoughtful. "The only time thyrsas have united into an army is when a strong leader has united them. It takes the intelligence and intimidation of an ettin to unite them into a single force and keep them under control."

"What are we going to do?" the theign asks desperately.

Until now, you'd been silent. The priest turns to you, and says, "Hidden in the temple is a cloak of stealth. With it, you should be able to sneak past the thyrs army."

"You must alert our allies of our plight!" the town theign declares.

## Meadhall

"You must hurry, I don't know how much longer we can hold out!"

### Priest

[The priest looks at you concerned. "You must get that cloak so that you can slip past the thyrs army and gather our allies to save us!"](?!got-cloak)
