**Part 1**

"A thyrs is a lonely fen dweller!" the town's thegn declares, "How can there be an army of them laying siege to our town?!"

The priest looks thoughtful. "The only time thyrsas have united into an army is when a strong leader has united them. It takes the intelligence and intimidation of an ettin to unite them into a single force and keep them under control."

"What are we going to do?" the thegn asks desperately.

Until now, you'd been silent. The priest turns to you, and says, "Hidden in the temple is a cloak of stealth. With it, you should be able to sneak past the thyrs army."

"You must alert our allies of our plight!" the town thegn declares.

## Meadhall

You can see [the thegn](#thegn) and [the priest](#priest) here.

You can [go south](/town-square) to exit the town hall.

### Theign

"You must alert our allies of this siege against us!" the thegn declares, "Once you get out of town, Tiwestun is to the east. To the west is our other ally Hrethfeld.

"You must hurry, I don't know how much longer we can hold out!"

### Priest

[The priest looks at you concerned. "You must get that cloak so that you can slip past the thyrs army and gather our allies to save us!](?!got-cloak)

["The cloak should be hidden under my bed in the cellar underneath the temple."](?!got-cloak)

["You have the cloak," the priest says, "Hurry, you must gather our allies!"](?got-cloak)

## Town Square

The streets are [full of people](#people), most of them walking around hopelessly. 

To [the north](/meadhall) is the meadhall, to [the east](/homes) are the homes of most the town's people, to [the south](/gate) is the town's gate.

### People

Most of the people are walking around disheveled and hungry. Due to the siege, food has had to be rationed. These people have lost all hope, just waiting for the inevitable attack of the thyrs army.

## Homes

> Not many people are out in the residential part of town. The one's you do see look disheveled and hungry.

To [the west](/town-square) is the town square, and to [the north](/temple) is the temple.

## Temple

[The altar](#altar) lies to the east. There are [stairs going down](/cellar) along the opposite wall. You [can exit](/homes) the temple by going south.

### Altar

The altar is littered with offerings of different kinds, and a large bowl in the middle with an eternal flame. The people will enter occasionally to say a quick prayer and deposit another gift on to the altar. The gifts will lie there undisturbed until the priest disposes of them by casting them into the large bowl with a fire inside during his evening offerings.

[You can ](?!made-offering)[make an offering](?!made-offering#made-offering)[, if you so choose.](?!made-offering)

### Made Offering

Inside the bag you are carrying is your daily rations. *I won't need them if I fail to make it past the thyrsas,* you think.

You say a prayer to the gods to help you sneak past the thyrsas, and then place your food on to the altar.

## [Cellar]("The Priest's Room")

The priest has a simple bedroom. Along one wall is a table with various scrolls and instruments that he uses in his duties as a priest. Along the other wall is [the Priest's bed](?!got-cloak&priest#got-cloak)[the Priest's bed](?!got-cloak&!priest)[the Priest's bed](?got-cloak). You can [go back up the steps](/temple) to exit the room.

### Got Cloak

The bed is a simple one, not much more than a cot on the ground. Reaching underneath it, you find a cloak. Pulling it out, you try to look at it but can't seem to focus your attention on it for some reason.

## Gate

Guards are on duty here, eyeing the sieging army.

> "I would not go out there," one of the guards say, "Those monsters have been killing people on sight."

To [the south](/the-thyrs-camp) is the thyrs army, with the highway going between your allies cities just beyond. To [the north](/town-square) is the town.

## [Gate](?got-cloak&made-offering)

Guards are on duty here, eyeing the sieging army.

To [the south](/fork-in-the-road) is the thyrs army, with the highway going between your allies cities just beyond. To [the north](/town-square) is the town.

## The Thyrs Camp

You do your best to try to sneak past the thyrs army, [and you make it farther than you normally would have but still get caught|but you are caught right away](?got-cloak). The thyrsas drag you to their leader, a large ettin with an ancient looking face.

"You thought you could get past my army, eh?" he asks, "I will make an example of you!"

[Perhaps you should have sought the favour of the gods before trying to sneak past the thyrs army?](?got-cloak)

The thyrsas behead you, stick your head on a pike, and place it where it's in clear view of the town's gate.

A week later, the town is attacked by the thyrsas. They leave little behind but burning ruins.

## Fork in the Road

> You do your best to sneak past the thyrs army. With your cloak tightly wrapped around, you quietly make your way through the thyrs camp. You almost bump into the largest of the thyrs, a gigantic monster with an ancient looking face, but you stop yourself in the nick of time.

> You've escaped town! Now, on to gather your allies!

> **Part 2**

[There's an army gathered here. They're from Tiwestun. The commander looks at you and declares, "We will be ready as soon as you return with the army of Hrethfeld!"](?priestess&!hrethfeld-thegn)

You are on a highway running [east](/woods) to [west](/fen) with a road going to the north leading back home. [According to the thegn, Tiwestun is to the east and Hrethfeld is to the west.](?thegn)

## [Fork in the Road](?saved-daughter)

**Part 3**

When the gathered armies see you approaching, they begin to cheer. The story of your defeat of the dragon had been getting told and retold as they awaited your arrival.

You are ushered into a huge tent, where you see the commanders of the gathered army. They only await your command.

This is as far as the adventure goes,
for now. Check back later for updates!

## Woods

> Out of the corner of your eye, you occasionally see some movement in the trees. According to legends, these woods are full of elves which consider these woods to be their gardens. Bad luck often befalls those who disturb the wildlife or foilage of these woods.

The road goes through some woods. You can follow it to [the northeast](/tiwestun) or to [the west](/fork-in-the-road).

## Fen

> You hold your cloak tightly wrapped around you. A thyrs is known to live in this fen, but you see no sign of him. *He must be in one of the camps laying siege to  my home,* you think glumly.

The road goes through a fen. You can follow it to [the west](/hrethfeld) or to [the east](/fork-in-the-road).

## Tiwestun

> You walk up to the guards at the gate and request to see the thegn. They ask you for your identity, and you respond by telling them about the siege to your home. The guard quickly let's you through the gate, and you find yourself in the midst of town.

To [the east](/tiwestun-meadhall#talked-to-thegn) is the town's meadhall where you will find the thegn[, and to ](?talked-to-thegn)[the west](/tiwestun-temple?talked-to-thegn#priestess)[ is the temple](?talked-to-thegn). To [the south](/woods) is the road heading back home.

## Tiwestun Meadhall

> The thegn greets you grimly. Apparently he's already heard the news. He strokes his beard thoughtfully as he says to you, "We cannot go to war without first consulting our town's patron god. Go talk to Tiw's priestess!"

[You and the thegn briefly chit chat for a few minutes before he ushers you out the door.](?!priestess)

[The thegn says to you, "The priestess has given the go-ahead! My army will meet you at the fork in the road that leads to your hometown!](?priestess)

You can [exit the meadhall](/tiwestun) by going west.

## Tiwestun Temple

> An elderly woman greets you as you enter the temple. "I've been waiting on you," she says, "A dream told me to expect you. In it, Tiw told me to give you his blessing, but only if you accept this gift from me. It is an ancient set of armour made by the ents, the ancient race of giants, makers of the best weapons and armour of the ancient world and the builders of its greatest cities. With this armour, you will see victory!"

The priestess urges you to continue your quest. "You have great things to accomplish! I shall make offerings on your behalf, to incur the favour of Tiw."

You can [exit the temple](/tiwestun) by going east.

## Hrethfeld

> You walk up to the guards at the gate and request to see the thegn. They ask you for your identity, and you respond by telling them about the siege to your home. The guard quickly let's you through the gate, and you find yourself in the midst of town.

To [the south](/hrethfeld-meadhall) is the Hrethfeld meadhall, where you will find the thegn. To [the north](/mountains) is a road leading into the mountains. To [the east](/fen) is the road leading home.

## [Hrethfeld](?saved-daughter)

> As you and the thegn's daughter enter town, the crowds are enthusiastically cheering. When you get to the entrance of the Meadhall, she gives you a kiss on the cheek before entering to see her father.

> A soldier walks up to you, and claps you on the shoulder. "The thegn is extremely grateful to you for saving his daughter! He's sending us to meet up with the forces of Tiwestun, and we shall await you there!"

To [the south](/hrethfeld-meadhall) is the Hrethfeld meadhall, where you will find the thegn. To [the east](/fen) is the road leading home.

## Hrethfeld Meadhall

> There's a lot of commotion as you enter the meadhall. The thegn is consulting with several people. You tell him of the siege of your home, but he dismisses you.

> "My daughter has been kidnapped by a dragon! I do not have time to wage a war at the moment."

> You offer your assistance, but he scoffs at you. "One blow of his fiery breath and you will be as roasted as Ingui's boar sacrifice on Mother's Night!"

The thegn refuses to pay you any more attention. The only thing you can do is [exit the meadhall](/hrethfeld) to the north.

## [Hrethfeld Meadhall](?priestess)

> As you enter the meadhall, the thegn sees the entish armour that you wear, and turns to face you. "Please, brave warrior, save my daughter! She's been kidnapped by a dragon and is being held in its lair in the mountains to the north!"

> You tell him of the siege of your town, and he replies, "Save my daughter, and my entire army is at your command! Take this sword, it will help you slay the dragon."

> He gives you a sword covered in runes, including the triple *tir* rune on its hilt that ensures victory to the bearer of the sword.

[The thegn embraces you enthusiastically. "Thank you so much for saving my daughter! My armies shall await you at the fork in the road that leads to your hometown! |The thegn urges you to hurry, "You must save my daughter!" ](?saved-daughter)You can [exit the meadhall](/hrethfeld#thegns-blessing) to the north.

## Mountains

> You see a guard at the entrance of a cave. "Halt! You can't go in there!"

[ You explain to the guard that you were sent by the thegn of Hrethfeld to save his daughter. The guard steps aside to let you | The guard refuses to let you past.](?thegns-blessing)[enter the cave.](/cave?thegns-blessing#saved-daughter) You can [return to Hrethfeld](/hrethfeld) by traveling south.

## [Mountains](?saved-daughter)

> The guard sees you escorting the thegn's daughter out of the cave, and begins to cheer. "I will let the thegn know the great news!" the guard declares as he begins to run towards town.

You can [return to Hrethfeld](/hrethfeld) by traveling south.

## [Cave]("Dragon's Lair")

> You enter the cave, and see a dragon sitting atop a huge pile of treasure. He's facing the corner of his lair, where a woman huddles in fear. He stops in the middle of a taunt, swinging his huge head around to face you. "What do we have here?" the dragon roars.

> "I am here to rescue the fair maiden. Hand her over, and I will spare your life!" you declare.

> The dragon laughs at you, breathing fire in your direction. But the entish armour that you wear protects you. You push ahead and with the sword you chop off the dragon's head.

> The thegn's daughter runs up to you and embraces you. Sobbing, she thanks you repeatedly for saving her life.

You can [exit the cave](/mountains) by heading to the east.
