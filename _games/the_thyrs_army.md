**Part 1**

"A thyrs is a lonely fen dweller!" the town's thegn declares, "How can there be an army of them laying siege to our town?!"

The priest looks thoughtful. "The only time thyrsas have united into an army is when a strong leader has united them. It takes the intelligence and intimidation of an ettin to unite them into a single force and keep them under control."

"What are we going to do?" the thegn asks desperately.

Until now, you'd been silent. The priest turns to you, and says, "Hidden in the temple is a cloak of stealth. With it, you should be able to sneak past the thyrs army."

"You must alert our allies of our plight!" the town thegn declares.

## Meadhall

You can see [the thegn](#thegn) and [the priest](#priest) here.

You can [go south](/town-square) to exit the town hall.

### Theign

"You must alert our allies of this siege against us!" the thegn declares, "Once you get out of town, Tiwestun is to the east. To the west is our other ally Hrethfeld.

"You must hurry, I don't know how much longer we can hold out!"

### Priest

[The priest looks at you concerned. "You must get that cloak so that you can slip past the thyrs army and gather our allies to save us!](?!got-cloak)

["The cloak should be hidden under my bed in the cellar underneath the temple."](?!got-cloak)

["You have the cloak," the priest says, "Hurry, you must gather our allies!"](?got-cloak)

## Town Square

The streets are [full of people](#people), most of them walking around hopelessly. 

To [the north](/meadhall) is the meadhall, to [the east](/homes) are the homes of most the town's people, to [the south](/gate) is the town's gate.

### People

Most of the people are walking around disheveled and hungry. Due to the siege, food has had to be rationed. These people have lost all hope, just waiting for the inevitable attack of the thyrs army.

## Homes

> Not many people are out in the residential part of town. The one's you do see look disheveled and hungry.

To [the west](/town-square) is the town square, and to [the north](/temple) is the temple.

## Temple

[The altar](#altar) lies to the east. There are [stairs going down](/cellar) along the opposite wall. You [can exit](/homes) the temple by going south.

### Altar

The altar is littered with offerings of different kinds, and a large bowl in the middle with an eternal flame. The people will enter occasionally to say a quick prayer and deposit another gift on to the altar. The gifts will lie there undisturbed until the priest disposes of them by casting them into the large bowl with a fire inside during his evening offerings.

[You can ](?!made-offering)[make an offering](?!made-offering#made-offering)[, if you so choose.](?!made-offering)

### Made Offering

Inside the bag you are carrying is your daily rations. *I won't need them if I fail to make it past the thyrsas,* you think.

You say a prayer to the gods to help you sneak past the thyrsas, and then place your food on to the altar.

## [Cellar]("The Priest's Room")

The priest has a simple bedroom. Along one wall is a table with various scrolls and instruments that he uses in his duties as a priest. Along the other wall is [the Priest's bed](?!got-cloak&priest#got-cloak)[the Priest's bed](?!got-cloak&!priest)[the Priest's bed](?got-cloak). You can [go back up the steps](/temple) to exit the room.

### Got Cloak

The bed is a simple one, not much more than a cloak on the ground. Reaching underneath it, you find a cloak. Pulling it out, you try to look at it but can't seem to focus your attention on it for some reason.

## Gate

Guards are on duty here, eyeing the sieging army.

> "I would not go out there," one of the guards say, "Those monsters have been killing people on sight."

To [the south](/the-thyrs-camp) is the thyrs army, with the highway going between your allies cities just beyond. To [the north](/town-square) is the town.

## [Gate](?got-cloak&made-offering)

Guards are on duty here, eyeing the sieging army.

To [the south](/fork-in-the-road) is the thyrs army, with the highway going between your allies cities just beyond. To [the north](/town-square) is the town.

## The Thyrs Camp

You do your best to try to sneak past the thyrs army, [and you make it farther than you normally would have but still get caught|but you are caught right away](?got-cloak). The thyrsas drag you to their leader, a large ettin with an ancient looking face.

"You thought you could get past my army, eh?" he asks, "I will make an example of you!"

[Perhaps you should have sought the favour of the gods before trying to sneak past the thyrs army?](?got-cloak)

The thyrsas behead you, stick your head on a pike, and place it where it's in clear view of the town's gate.

A week later, the town is attacked by the thyrsas. They leave little behind but burning ruins.

## Fork in the Road

> You do your best to sneak past the thyrs army. With your cloak tightly wrapped around, you quietly make your way through the thyrs camp. You almost bump into the largest of the thyrs, a gigantic monster with an ancient looking face, but you stop yourself in the nick of time.

> You've escaped town! Now, on to gather your allies!

> **Part 2**

You are on a highway running [east](/woods) to [west](/fen) with a road going to the north leading back home. [According to the thegn, Tiwestun is to the east and Hrethfeld is to the west.](?thegn)

## Woods

> Out of the corner of your eye, you occasionally see some movement in the trees. According to legends, these woods are full of elves which consider these woods to be their gardens. Bad luck often befalls those who disturb the wildlife or foilage of these woods.

The road goes through some woods. You can follow it to [the northeast](/tiwestun) or to [the west](/fork-in-the-road).

## Fen

> You hold your cloak tightly wrapped around you. A thyrs is known to live in this fen, but you see no sign of him. *He must be in one of the camps laying siege to  my home,* you think glumly.

The road goes through a fen. You can follow it to [the west](/hrethfeld) or to [the east](/fork-in-the-road).

## Tiwestun

> You walk up to the guards at the gate and request to see the thegn. They ask you for your identity, and you respond by telling them about the siege to your home. The guard quickly let's you through the gate, and you find yourself in the midst of town.

To [the east](/tiwestun-meadhall#talked-to-thegn) is the town's meadhall where you will find the thegn[, and to ](?talked-to-thegn)[the west](/tiwestun-temple?talked-to-thegn#priestess)[ is the temple](?talked-to-thegn). To [the south](/woods) is the road heading back home.

## Tiwestun Meadhall

> The thegn greets you grimly. Apparently he's already heard the news. He strokes his beard thoughtfully as he says to you, "We cannot go to war without first consulting our town's patron god. Go talk to Tiw's priestess!"

[You and the thegn briefly chit chat for a few minutes before heushers you out the door.](?!priestess)

[The thegn says to you, "The priestess has given the go-ahead! My army will meet you at the fork in the road that leads to your hometown!](?priestess)

You can [exit the meadhall](/tiwestun) by going west.

## Tiwestun Temple

> An elderly woman greets you as you enter the temple. "I've been waiting on you," she says, "A dream told me to expect you. In it, Tiw told me to give you his blessing, but only if you accept this gift from me. It is an ancient set of armour, made by the best craftsmen of the ancient world.

> "As you know, the ents were an ancient race of giants, the makers of the best weapons and armour, and builders of the ancient world's greatest cities. With this armour, you will see victory!"

The priestess urges you to continue your quest. "You have great things to accomplish! I shall make offerings on your behalf, to incur the favour of Tiw."

You can [exit the temple](/tiwestun) by going east.

## Hrethfeld

> You walk up to the guards at the gate and request to see the thegn. They ask you for your identity, and you respond by telling them about the siege to your home. The guard quickly let's you through the gate, and you find yourself in the midst of town.
