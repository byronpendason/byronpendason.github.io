# [The Ettin in the Woods](your-home)

A choose your own adventure style game by **Byron Pendason**

*Version 1.0*

## Your Home

> A blood curdling scream wakes you from your slumber. Your stumble out of your bed and look around. 

Your home is a simple one. Your bed is a cot on the ground, and your mom's cot is on the opposite side of the room. It is empty.

> She is nowhere to be found.

On the west wall is a fireplace. To [the east](front-yard#been-outside) is the door to the outside.

## Front Yard

> You run out into front yard, looking around frantically for your mother.

> Again, she's nowhere to be found.

To [the west](your-home) is your home.
