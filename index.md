## Welcome to MÄ«ne Wyrtruman!

This website is dedicated to ***Fyrnsidu***, a modern religion based upon the religion of the
pre-Christian Germanic tribes that settled in Britain in the fifth century of the common era.
These people, commonly known as the Anglo-Saxons, brought with them a religion that is both
similar to, yet distinct from, the religion of the pre-Christian Nordic peoples. Fyrnsidu is a
religion based upon the worship of the Anglo-Saxon gods, one's ancestors, and the wights (spirits)
of the land around us and in our homes. If you're curious about Fyrnsidu, check out my slideshow [Introduction to Fyrnsidu](/fyrnsidu_intro/). The best resource to learn more about Fyrnsidu is [Fyrnsidu.faith](https://Fyrnsidu.faith).
