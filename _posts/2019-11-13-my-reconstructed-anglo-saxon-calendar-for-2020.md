For details on how I reconstruct my calendar, see my page on <a href="/the-anglo-saxon-calendar/">the Anglo-Saxon calendar</a>. I will add a couple notes here, however.

This year has thirteen new moons between the previous   December solstice and this year's December solstice. Therefore, the leap month is added between the sixth and   seventh months.

The months begin on the young moon, when the first sliver of the moon is visible after the new moon. I estimate this by adding 36 hours to the new moon's time.

<h2>Holy Tides</h2>

Ēostre is on Tuesday April 07, 2020.
Midsummer is on Saturday June 20, 2020.
Winterfylleþ is on Saturday October 31, 2020.
Modraniht (Yule) is on Monday December 21, 2020.

Ēostre is the beginning of summer (the Anglo-Saxons only recognized two seasons, winter and summer). It welcomes the goddess Ēostre back, and celebrates life as it returns all around in nature after the harshness of winter.

Midsummer is a celebration of the summer and life in its abundance.

Winterfylleþ is the begining of winter. We bid the goddess Ēostre farewell as she begins her journey. Since nature is beginning to die all around us, many Heathens also commemorate their loved ones who have passed on. Offerings to one's ancestors are especially appropriate here.

Yule is the middle of winter. In ancient times, it was a time of celebration for having survived this far into the winter. Family was cherished, as they never knew who would survive through the rest of the winter and still be here in the spring time. As the gifting cycle was an important part of ancient heathen culture, gifts were exchanged to show the appreciation you had for those in your family.
