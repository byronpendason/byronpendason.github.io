<p>I've added an Old English keyboard to RuneTyper. In addition to all the runes, it should have all the letters you need to type in Old English, including Ƿ, Þ, Ᵹ, Ð, Æ, ⁊, and Ꝥ. It has two function keys: SH toggles between capitalising and lowercase the letters, while ALT adds the bars over vowels to make them long, and the dots over c and g. Check out the screenshot below:</p>

<p>I'm working on getting it up on the Google Play Store, but have ran into some snafus getting my Google Play Console account set up. It may take a while to get it resolved, but there's no need to to wait until then to get the app. You can download it below!</p>
