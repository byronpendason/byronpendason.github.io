I have done major revision on portions of my <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="/2020/02/25/hretha-the-victorious-spring-goddess/">post discussing Hretha</a>. Particularly, I added the Greek goddess of victory, Nike, to the post, I expanded upon my thoughts on Andastre (the Celtic Icenic goddess), and added thoughts about March being a war between summer and winter. I also revised my theory about the connection between them, which proved to be controversial among the Heathens that I shared that post with.
