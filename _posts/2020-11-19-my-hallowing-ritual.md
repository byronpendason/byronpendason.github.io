<p><em>Wes þu hāl</em>! When I wrote my blog post about <a href="/2020/01/04/my-ritual-format/">My Ritual Format</a>, I was in a bit of a pickle due to the Hallowing section of it. I had just learned that the <em>Weonde </em>song that I had been using was written by a very unsavory character (Swain Wodening). So I wrote a short invocation to the flame itself asking it to hallow my altar area. It works (fire itself has an intrinsic power in Heathen ritual), but it never felt quite right.</p>

<p>Shortly after I wrote that blog post, I discovered the <a href="https://windintheworldtrees.com/2017/07/10/taking-sacred-space/">Hallowing</a> ritual used on Wind in the Worldtree blog. I fell in love with it instantly. It was written for outside rituals, so I adapted it slightly for use with an indoor ritual. So without further ado, here is how I do my Hallowing.</p>

<p>You will need two candles. One is your hearth fire, I like to use a votive candle for it. The second candle will be your "torch" candle. I like to use a small taper candle because it somewhat resembles a torch.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Light the torch candle. Holding the torch candle high over the edge of my altar that is opposite me, I say: "<em>May the gods guide us!</em>"</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then I move the candle to the edge of the altar that is to my right, and say: "<em>May our oaths keep us!</em>"</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Holding the candle over the edge of the altar closest to me, I say: "<em>May our deeds free us!</em>"   </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Holding the candle over the left edge of the altar, I say: "<em>May our ancestors aid us always!</em>"</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then, starting back at the edge of the altar opposite me, I will circle the altar three times with the torch candle, saying this (one line for each rotation):</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>"May the gods banish from this place all ill and wrong, |</em><br><em>Hallow this space, shield this area from all baneful wights. |</em><br><em>Let the gods’ blessing be over our heads!"</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the torch candle, light the hearth candle. I then place the torch candle in a candle holder that sits next to the hearth fire, and start my prayers.</p>

<p>It's a simple little ritual, but unlike other Hallowing rituals it is based upon the  Anglo-Saxon corpus. This gives it a little historicity. Beofeld (the author of <em>Wind in the Worldtree</em>) based it upon Lacnunga 133 (an Old English charm against "<em>flying poison</em>"), but  re-heathenized it. It's worked powerfully for me. If you're looking for a Hallowing ritual, I highly recommend giving it a try.</p>
