*Wes hāl!*[^1] Some of you who follow me on Twitter may have noticed my conspicuous absence. Twitter has become so toxic. Part of it, I'm sure, has been Elon Musk's acquisition of the platform. But to be honest, it's been this way for a long time. I've just failed to see it. Being betrayed by a couple of people I considered allies really opened my eyes to the way Twitter operates, and I don't want to have any part of it any longer. I've been a lot happier since deleting the app, and my mental health has gotten a lot better!

So I'm deleting my Twitter account. I'll give it a couple days, so people who follow my blog posts through that platform have a chance to see this so they're aware that if they want to continue to follow this blog, they need to figure out how to do that. I'll give a couple suggestions on how to do that in this blog post.

I usually post links to my blog posts to a couple of Discord servers I'm on. I even run my own with a couple friends. It's called *Polytheist Scholars & Nerds*. It's a server for polytheists (people who believe in many literal gods) who's hobbies and/or careers give them an interest in intellectual pursuits to get together and hang out. (The label *Scholar* is more aspirational and/or tongue in cheek for most of us! I'm definitely not a scholar, though many people have called me a nerd!) If this describes you, feel free to check it out at <https://discord.gg/ZuWv7fMHzj>!

If you use an RSS reader, you can get notifications of any updates to my blog. Just add <https://www.minewyrtruman.com/feed.xml> to your RSS subscriptions! Bonus tip, you can add any WordPress site to your RSS feed by adding `<blog-url>/feed.xml`. For example, to add Beofeld's excellent blog [Wind in the Worldtree](https://windintheworldtree.wordpress.com), just add <https://windintheworldtree.wordpress.com/feed.xml> to your RSS subscriptions.

There's also the old fashioned way of checking the blog every so often for updates, but it's so easy to forget and miss new content. The next thing you know, you're so far behind. It's your choice though.

I have other ideas that I may implement in the future, but for now these are the ways that I know of to follow this blog.

You may be curious about what's been going on in my life if you've gotten used to reading my tweets. Well, it's been hectic. Feel free to reach out to me on Discord or in the comments below if you'd like to know some of the details! Just remember, I won't be responding on Twitter.

I'll post a couple blog related updates here, though. I've been working on a video review, and finally finished the rough draft (the final blog post should be posted in a few days). I've been studying a lot of philosophy lately, trying to systematise my own philosophy. I might be starting work on a blog post about that soon, perhaps.

*Beo gesund!*[^1]

[^1]: *Wes hāl* and *Beo gesund* are Old English greetings and farewells that literally mean *Be well/whole/healthy*. The first seemed to be more common among the Anglian dialects and the second more common among the Saxon dialects. I prefer to use both though, the first as a greeting and the second as a farewell.
