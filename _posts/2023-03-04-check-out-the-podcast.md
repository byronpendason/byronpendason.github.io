*Wes hāl!*[^1] It occurred to me today they I never created a blog post about my podcast. It's been going for a little over a month, so I'm overdue for an official announcement, I suppose.

The Podcast is called *Mine Wyrtruman Radio*. I have a page on it on this blog, so for more information and to find out where to listen go to [Mine Wyrtruman Radio](https://www.MineWyrtruman.com/minewyrtrumanradio)!

*Beo gesund!*[^1]

[^1]: *Wes hāl* and *Beo gesund* are Old English greetings and farewells that literally mean *Be well/whole/healthy*. The first seemed to be more common among the Anglian dialects and the second more common among the Saxon dialects. I prefer to use both though, the first as a greeting and the second as a farewell.
