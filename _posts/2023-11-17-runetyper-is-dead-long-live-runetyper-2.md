*Wes hāl!*[^1] RuneTyper has been unpublished from the Google Play Store. I had lost the source code to it a while back, and it wasn't even being shown on the Play Store for most people because it targets an older version of Android. I did take the time to rewrite it from scratch, and went to upload it to the Play Store. Unfortunately, I couldn't update it because of Google Play's ever changing requirements. They were threatening to remove it anyways because of it needing to get updated, but because I couldn't update it I decided to preemptively remove it. If you already have it installed on your Android device, you will keep it until you uninstall it. However, if you want the updated version for RuneTyper that I made you can get the APK (Android installation file) from Google Drive [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/102xA_AyWBzC7zm4UaI92OptDCijVIHt8/view?usp=drivesdk). However, there's a much better solution in my opinion.

I turned RuneTyper into a progressive web app (PWA). It's called [RuneTyper 2](https://www.minewyrtruman.com/runetyper). Being a PWA means you can run it directly from your browser. It also means that you can install it directly to your device through your web browser. For more info about it, click on the RuneTyper 2 link at the beginning of this paragraph, and press the ***Help*** button. You should also be able to use it on any device that has internet access including PCs and iPhones.

For this version, I added a fifth rune set (Medieval runes). I also added the most requested feature request of the original Android app: the app will now automatically load the last rune set you were using when you start the app each time.

I hope you enjoy RuneTyper 2. Feel free to leave any comments or constructive criticism that you may have about it in the comments section below!

*Beo gesund!*[^1]

[^1]: *Wes hāl* and *Beo gesund* are Old English greetings and farewells that literally mean *Be well/whole/healthy*. The first seemed to be more common among the Anglian dialects and the second more common among the Saxon dialects. I prefer to use both though, the first as a greeting and the second as a farewell.
