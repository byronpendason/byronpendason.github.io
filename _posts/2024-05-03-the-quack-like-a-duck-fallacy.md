I think most of us have gotten good at judging how true something is based on our first impressions. If it sounds like something that could be true, we assume it's true and move on with our day. If it's something that sounds absurd, we likewise reject the proposition and move on. We've pretty much had to. with the internet being so pervasive in our modern lives, we comes across more information than we could possibly ever have time to possibly verify. And this system works decently when it's subjects that we are well acquainted with. We can run into problems though when it's something that we know a lot about on one subject, but also know very little about on other subjects the information deals with. This problem has become an issue in modern Paganism when it pertains to things that are supposedly Christian intventions.
