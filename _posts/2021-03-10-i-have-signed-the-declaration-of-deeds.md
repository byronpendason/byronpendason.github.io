<p>As long as I have been a Heathen, Heathens have been complaining about Declaration 127. Rightfully so, as it is entirely inadequate as an inclusivity statement. It's a condemnation of a racist organization- the Asatru Folk Assembly. That is admirable, but it's not an inclusivity statement. Inclusive Heathenry has been trying to shoe horn into something it's not.</p>

<p>Beofeld, author of the Anglo-Saxon Heathen blog <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://windintheworldtrees.com/" target="_blank">Wind in the Worldtree</a>, has written such an inclusivity and non-bigotry statement. Called the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.DeclarationofDeeds.com" target="_blank">Declaration of Deeds</a>, it makes clear that there is no basis in Heathenry for prejudice based upon things outside one's control such as race, sex, gender identity, etc. It is a much stronger and better defined statement of inclusivity and non-bigotry for Heathenry.</p>

<p>I want to declare that I agree with and am in support of Beofeld's Declaration of Deeds. I have signed it, and I encourage all of my readers to give it a read and to sign it if you agree with it. This is a grassroots movement, but together we can accomplish something great- steer Heathenry away from the Folkism that so many non-Heathens assume all of us Heathens belong to. Join us in our bid to make Heathenry inclusive to all!</p>
