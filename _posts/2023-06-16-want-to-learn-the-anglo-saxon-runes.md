*Wes hāl!*[^1]

The last few days, I have been busy working on a couple projects for this blog, both having to do the the Futhorc (Anglo-Saxons Runes). The most useful in terms of starting out with writing in the Futhorc is [a webapp](https://www.minewyrtruman.com/learn_futhorc/) that I created for this blog. Its a flashcard-like program that has 8 levels. The first level starts you off with 8 runes, each which represents a two-letter combination in my system for writing the Futhorc. Then each subsequent level adds 5 more runes, until you get to all 33 in the 6th level. The 7th level adds the three punctuation marks that I use in my runic writing. The eighth (and the final) level will randomly select 20 words  out of the 97 most common words[^2] in modern English to give you practice reading the runes. Be sure to read the notes I included to get some tips for making the learning process easier!

The other resource is [Gummere's translation of Beowulf, rendered in runes](https://www.minewyrtruman.com/beowulf_runes/). This is a great resource to get practice reading modern English written in Futhorc runes once you've learned what each rune represents.

These resources took a lot of time and effort to create these resources, so if you find them useful please consider [buying me a coffee](https://ko-fi.com/byronthefyrnsidere) or two to compensate me for the work.

Anyways, just a couple updates on what I've been up to. *Beo gesund!*[^1]

[^1]: *Wes hāl* and *Beo gesund* are Old English greetings and farewells that literally mean *Be well/whole/healthy*. The first seemed to be more common among the Anglian dialects and the second more common among the Saxon dialects. I prefer to use both though, the first as a greeting and the second as a farewell.

[^2]: It was originally a list of the 100 most common words but I removed the single letter words.
