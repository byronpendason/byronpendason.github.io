*Wes hāl!*[^1] Last month, I celebrated five years in Fyrnsidu, and I thought a good way to commemorate that would be to write up a brief history of Fyrnsidu and it's predecessors. On my home page, I define Fyrnsidu as "a modern religion based upon the religion of the pre-Christian Germanic tribes that settled in Britain in the fifth century of the common era." Today, we usually define it as Anglo-Saxon Heathenry, but it was originally meant as an alternative to Theodism. More on them in a bit though, first I want to explore the influences leading up to it. So let's dive right in!

## Ancient Roots

The Anglo-Saxons were a group of Germanic tribes that settled in Britain in the fifth century. They brought with them a polytheistic religion that was most likely similar to, yet distinct from, their Norse cousins. While we don't know every detail of what their faith consisted of, we do have some details from historical, literary, and archeological sources. We can combine this with what we know of their culture, and the cultures of those they were related to and came into contact with to create an approximate reconstruction of their religion.

Christianisation of the Anglo-Saxons began in the final years of the sixth century, and was complete by the close of the seventh century. A lot of information was lost at that point, but as I said, I feel confident we can recreate an approximate reconstruction of their religion.

## Seax-Wica

In modern times, the first religion to take inspiration from the ancient Anglo-Saxons was Wicca. While many of the holidays in the wheel of the year are from Celtic sources, some are also from Anglo-Saxons sources (most notably, Yule). The name itself Wicca is the Old English word for witch. It's founder Gerald Gardner claimed it was the native faith of English witches, which is undoubtedly false. However, he was a student of English history, and he heavily relied upon his knowledge of the Anglo-Saxons for his reconstruction of native British witchcraft.

Seax-Wica took this a step farther when founded in America by Raymond Buckland in 1973[^2], and relabeled everything with Anglo-Saxon terminology. The Lord and Lady were called Wōden and Freyja (though some modern groups have replaced Freyja with Woden's wife Frīge), and the holidays were given Old English names. A lot of the terminology was also changed to be Anglo-Saxon, for example the athame became the seax (the short sword that Saxon warriors were known for).

It remained Wiccan in practice and theology, however. It was still duotheistic (all the male gods were seen as manifestations of the Lord, and all goddesses were seen as manifestations of the Lady), still followed the wheel of the year, and practices remained distinctly Wiccan. 

Buckland admitted that Seax-Wica wasn't meant to be a reconstruction of the ancient Anglo-Saxons's religion,  but it would later lead to the creation of Theodism, our next step in the journey to modern Fyrnsidu.
