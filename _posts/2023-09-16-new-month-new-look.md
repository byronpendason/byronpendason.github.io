*Wes hāl!*[^1] Today begins the month of Haligmonað, and with the new month I'm happy to announce the new look for Mine Wyrtruman!

The month of Haligmonað roughly corresponds with September. It translates as *holy month*. We're not sure what made this month holy to the ancient Anglo-Saxons, but it probably involved rites that had something to do with the upcoming harvest. The Ingwine Society celebrates [Hærfestlíc Freólsung](https://ingwine.org/knowledge-base-2/the-holy-calendar/) beginning the full moon of this month. To quote their website:

> The Autumnal Festival, or in Old English, Hærfestlíc Freólsung, is a celebration of the final stages of bringing in or “ingathering” cereal and vegetable crops. By the time the next major holy tide of Winter-fylleþ had arrived, crops were considered subject to being “blasted” by a púca, which is to say, afflicted by frost and rendered inedible.

So, let's shift gears and talk about the new website look. A few days ago, my friend Rose and I were talking about [my calendar page](https://www.minewyrtruman.com/anglosaxoncalendar) and I mentioned how ugly my JavaScript code for that page is. You see, I'm a self taught programmer who programs as a hobby. I am ignorant when it comes to what makes for good looking code or best programming practices. She offered to help me refactor the code, to make it more efficient and make the code look prettier. I accepted, and in the process of doing that we got to talking about how dated my website looked (it really gave off 1999 vibes, didn't it?) and so she offered to help me with that as well.

Long story short, this new look is the result. It's almost entirely her doing (I did help a little!). She did the work pro bono, but if you enjoy the new look or the better functioning website, please consider heading over to her Amazon page and buying [her books](https://www.amazon.com/stores/Sara-Cleveland/author/B00TGVU086). Yes  she's a fantasy author as well! Also, feel free going down to the comments and leaving your thoughts on the new look!

*Beo gesund!*[^1]

[^1]: *Wes hāl* and *Beo gesund* are Old English greetings and farewells that literally mean *Be well/whole/healthy*. The first seemed to be more common among the Anglian dialects and the second more common among the Saxon dialects. I prefer to use both though, the first as a greeting and the second as a farewell.
