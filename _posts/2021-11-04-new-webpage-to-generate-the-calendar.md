<p>A lot of Heathens avoid using an ancient lunisolar calendar (such as my reconstructed calendar) because of the hassle of calculating it all out. With this in mind, I programmed a webpage that will calculate the my Reconstructed Anglo-Saxon Calendar for any year. It includes the start of each month, the full moons, and the holy tides for any year that you input. Additionally, I have a date converter at the bottom of the page so that you can convert any Gregorian Calendar date to the Anglo-Saxon date.</p>

<p>I have more plans for the webpage in the future. I plan to add the keeping track of the Metonic Cycle, and I would like to add more holidays. If you have any suggestions for more features, feel free to put it in the comments!</p>
