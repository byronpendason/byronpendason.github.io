*Wes hāl!*[^1] I have become a student of Stoicism, but as I said in my last blog post Stoicism is not a Germanic philosophy. It was born in the Hellenic world, and was later adopted by the Romans. I have been accused in the past of trying to push a Heathen orthodoxy[^2], and I'm sure such people will want to try to push the claim that I'm pushing for Stoicism to be a part of some Heathen orthodoxy or try to push their own orthodoxy that I'm not really a Heathen for adopting Stoicism. So, in this blog post, I want to discuss the relationship between Stoicism and Heathenry. So let's dive in!

First of all, I want to reiterate my belief that Stoicism is not a Heathen philosophy. I'm adopting it as a personal philosophy, and will not push it upon anyone else. I will share some thoughts about it, but I'm a blogger and so sharing my thoughts is in my nature. As I use categories to tag my blog posts, it should be easy for anyone who doesn't want to read about Stoicism to ignore the posts that deal with it.

So the question becomes, is Stoicism compatible with a Heathen worldview? There are certainly similarities between classical philosophy (i.e., the philosophy of the Greeks and Romans of the classical era) and Old Norse philosophy. Sveignbjorn Johnson points out that the goal of life for both was happiness, and that happiness could only be obtained by living a virtuous life[^3]. The wisdom of the Havamal, in a lot of places, matches the practical wisdom of the ancient Stoics[^4], and I've talked to a lot of Heathens who use Stoicism as a personal code of ethics.

Modern Stoicism seems to downplay the logic and tries to eliminate cosmology of the ancient Stoics[^5], but it seems to me that little in them would contradict Heathenry, and nothing that can't be tweaked slightly whine remaining true to the core principles of ancient Stoicism. This may seem like a bold claim, of course, but the biggest issue I see is that of the pantheistic god.  But the point of the pantheistic god was to show that the world was providentially ordered in order to build up the rest of the philosophy. Seeing that god instead as the collective whole of the gods (which I like to term the divine Þing or Assembly of the gods), working together with a unified purpose, does no harm to the philosophy as far as I can tell. I have Providence on my list of topics to write on, so I will leave this topic for now.

In short, I see no reason why Stoicism cannot fit into the personal philosophy of individual Heathens. I actually feel like they compliment each other quite well. In future blog posts, I will elaborate more as my understanding of Stoicism grows[^6], but until then feel free to leave your thoughts in the comments below!

*Beo gesund!*[^1]

[^1]: *Wes hāl* and *Beo gesund* are Old English greetings and farewells that literally mean *Be well/whole/healthy*. The first seemed to be more common among the Anglian dialects and the second more common among the Saxon dialects. I prefer to use both though, the first as a greeting and the second as a farewell.

[^2]: This accusation is an inaccurate one, as I've never pushed for any kind of orthodoxy within Heathenry. I've promoted my own views, of course, and have at times argued for them pretty zealously. I have never, however, claimed any of my views was The Correct Heathen View™ (orthodoxy means *correct beliefs*, after all) nor have I employed the *no true Scotsman* fallacy to say those who disagree with me are not really Heathens. As I've stated before, I define a Heathen as one who self-identities as one and who's spirituality is based upon one of the pre-Christian Germanic tribes.

[^5]: There is a movement within modern Stoicism to reverse this trend, and I've been finding my research into traditional Stoicism (as the adherants of this movement like to call themselves) fascinating, and finding *a lot* of agreement between myself and them. I can't recommend <https://traditionalstoicism.com/> highly enough, especially the first 15 episodes of his podcast *Stoicism on Fire* and the author's paper [Providence or Atoms- a very brief defense of the Stoic worldview](https://traditionalstoicism.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Providence-or-Atoms-a-very-brief-defense-of-the-Stoic-worldview.pdf) (2015) for those who would like to more.

[^6]: The first 15 episodes of the aforementioned podcast *Stoicism on Fire* and/or the website associated with it work really well as an introduction to the ethics, logic, and physics of the philosophy of the ancient Stoics.
