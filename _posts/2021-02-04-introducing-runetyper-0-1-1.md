<p>I created an app that uses Kivy/Python to be able to type Fuþorc runes (also called Anglo-Saxon or Anglo-Frisian runes) and copy it to the clipboard so that you can paste it into other apps. It's currently only available for Android at the moment.</p>

<p>Here's a screenshot of the app. In the text input, the screenshot has <em>Wes þu hal</em> (OE for <em>Hello</em>) written in runes: ᚹᛖᛋ᛫ᚦᚢ᛫ᚻᚪᛚ᛬</p>

<p>I have big plans for this app. An ambitious plan is to allow one to switch between the various rune sets for the keyboard, but currently only the Fuþorc is available in the app. I also plan to release Windows and Linux versions, but need to add keyboard support first. If you can think of any other features that you'd like to suggest or run into any problems, post a comment below. If you enjoy the app or have any constructive criticism, please let me know in the comments as well!</p>

I'm currently hosting it on my Google Drive, but will be starting a Github project for it soon. I will include the source code there as well when I get it set up. </p>
