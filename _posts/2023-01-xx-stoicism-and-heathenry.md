*Wes hāl!*[^1] I have recently become a student of Stoicism, but as I said in my last blog post Stoicism is not a Germanic philosophy. It was born in the Hellenic world, and was later adopted by the Romans. In this blog post, I want to discuss the relationship between Stoicism and Heathenry. What are the similarities, the differences, and are they even compatible? So let's dive in!

First of all, I want to reiterate my belief that Stoicism is not a Heathen philosophy. I'm adopting it as a personal philosophy, and will not push it upon anyone else. I will share some thoughts about it, but I'm a blogger and so sharing my thoughts is in my nature. As I use categories to tag my blog posts, it should be easy for anyone who doesn't want to read about Stoicism to ignore the posts that deal with it.

So the question is, is Stoicism compatible with a Heathen worldview? There are certainly similarities between classical philosophy (i.e., the philosophy of the Greeks and Romans of the classical era) and Old Norse philosophy. Sveignbjorn Johnson points out that the goal of life for both was happiness, and that happiness could only be obtained by living a virtuous life[^3]. The wisdom of the Havamal, in a lot of places, matches the practical wisdom of the ancient Stoics[^4]. I've talked to a lot of modern Heathens who use Stoicism as a personal code of ethics, and as I've joined their ranks I can definitely see the appeal to it. In the classical world, it was one of the most popular systems of philosophy. It was certainly a diverse school. It represented every be walk of life, from the former slave Epictetus to the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius. It was a comprehensive system that consisted of not only ethics, but also logic and physics (cosmology).

Modern Stoicism seems to downplay the logic and tries to eliminate the cosmology of the ancient Stoics[^5], but it seems to me that little in even the cosmology would contradict Heathenry, and nothing that can't be tweaked slightly while remaining true to the core principles of ancient Stoicism. This may seem like a bold claim, of course, but the biggest issue I see is that of the pantheistic god. The ancient Stoics believed in a single eternal god that was identified as the universe. Some Stoics seemed to believe in other gods alongside this supreme God, but they were merely created beings who were more powerful than humans but neither all powerful nor eternal. Only the supreme God we eternal, all other gods would eventually be absorbed back into God along with the rest of the universe.

While this theology is certainly viable in modern Heathenry, it's not a theology that very many Heathens would grant their ascent to. I certainly don't believe that their is an omniscient and omnipotent god. But the point of the pantheistic god was to show that the world was providentially ordered in order to build up the rest of the philosophy. Seeing that God instead as the collective whole of the gods (which I like to term the divine Þing or Assembly of the gods), working together with a unified purpose, does no harm to the philosophy as far as I can tell. I have Providence on my list of topics to write on, so I will leave this topic for now.

I see no reason why Stoicism cannot fit into the personal philosophy of individual Heathens. I actually feel like they compliment each other quite well. In future blog posts, I will elaborate more as my understanding of Stoicism grows^6, but until then feel free to leave your thoughts in the comments below!

*Beo gesund!*[^1]

[^1]: *Wes hāl* and *Beo gesund* are Old English greetings and farewells that literally mean *Be well/whole/healthy*. The first seemed to be more common among the Anglian dialects and the second more common among the Saxon dialects. I prefer to use both though, the first as a greeting and the second as a farewell.

[^5]: There is a movement within modern Stoicism to reverse this trend, and I've been finding my research into traditional Stoicism (as the adherents of this movement like to call themselves) fascinating, and finding *a lot* of agreement between myself and them. I can't recommend <https://traditionalstoicism.com/> highly enough, especially the first 15 episodes of his podcast *Stoicism on Fire* and the author's paper [Providence or Atoms- a very brief defense of the Stoic worldview](https://traditionalstoicism.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Providence-or-Atoms-a-very-brief-defense-of-the-Stoic-worldview.pdf) (2015) for those who would like to more.

[^6]: The first 15 episodes of the aforementioned podcast *Stoicism on Fire* and/or the website associated with it work really well as an introduction to the ethics, logic, and physics of the philosophy of the ancient Stoics.
