# Wisdomlic-Wæg

## Integrating the Ancient Ethics of Stoicism into Anglo-Saxon Heathenry

Wisdomlic-Wæg is a spiritual path that seamlessly blends the principles of Stoicism with the rich heritage of Anglo-Saxon Heathen cosmology and theology. At its core, it is a path of wisdom and virtuous living, where individuals strive to live in accordance with the divine order and the will of the gods.

The Wisdomlic-Wæg recognizes the existence of a pantheon of gods and goddesses who govern different aspects of the natural world and human experience, and encourages individuals to cultivate their own virtues as a way of honoring these deities and contributing to the divine order of the universe.

One of the central teachings of the Wisdomlic-Wæg is that individuals are responsible for their own lives and must work to maintain the balance and harmony of the universe. This includes living in accordance with the will of the gods, but also involves taking proactive steps to develop their own virtues and contribute to the well-being of their community. This could involve volunteering, helping others, or simply living a life that is grounded in compassion and respect for all beings.

In terms of practices, the Wisdomlic-Wæg offers a range of options for individuals to deepen their connection to the divine order and the gods.

## The Cosmology of Wisdomlic-Wæg

Wisdomlic-Wæg has a rich and complex cosmology that provides a framework for understanding the nature of the world and one's place within it. This cosmology encompasses a wide range of beliefs and practices that are central to the path, and it provides a foundation for the pursuit of virtue and the cultivation of a harmonious and fulfilling life.

At the heart of the Wisdomlic-Wæg cosmology is the concept of the divine order. This is the idea that the world is governed by a set of principles and laws that govern the interactions between all things, from the smallest particles to the largest structures in the universe. These principles and laws are seen as being established by a higher power, and they are considered to be beyond human control.

The divine order is also seen as being expressed through the natural world, and practitioners of Wisdomlic-Wæg seek to understand and live in accordance with this order. This involves a deep appreciation and respect for the natural world and its cycles and rhythms, and a recognition of one's place within this larger system.

One of the key ways that practitioners of Wisdomlic-Wæg seek to understand the divine order is through the practice of introspection and self-reflection. This involves taking time to reflect on one's thoughts, feelings, and actions, and to examine one's relationship with the world and with others. Through this process, practitioners seek to gain insight into the workings of the divine order, and to better understand their own place within it.

The cosmology of Wisdomlic-Wæg also incorporates the idea of the soul, which is seen as being separate from the physical body and as being an integral part of the divine order. The soul is considered to be the seat of consciousness, and it is thought to be immortal and to persist beyond the death of the physical body. The pursuit of wisdom, virtue, and a harmonious life is seen as being essential for the soul's growth and development.

In conclusion, the cosmology of Wisdomlic-Wæg provides a rich and complex framework for understanding the world and one's place within it.

## The Dichotomy of Control

One of the central tenets of Wisdomlic-Wæg is the dichotomy of control. This concept holds that there are two types of events in life: those that are within our control and those that are not. The dichotomy of control is a crucial part of the Wisdomlic-Wæg philosophy, as it provides practitioners with a framework for distinguishing between what they can control and what they cannot, and for directing their focus and efforts accordingly.

Events that are within our control include our thoughts, feelings, and actions. These are aspects of our lives that are within our power to change, and that are directly influenced by our choices and decisions. By focusing on these events, practitioners of Wisdomlic-Wæg seek to cultivate virtues such as prudence, fortitude, justice, and temperance, and to live a harmonious and fulfilling life.

On the other hand, events that are not within our control include external circumstances, such as natural disasters, the actions of others, and even death. These events are beyond our power to control or influence, and it is important to recognize this and to not waste energy or resources trying to control them. Instead, Wisdomlic-Wæg teaches practitioners to focus on how they respond to these events, and to cultivate a sense of equanimity and acceptance in the face of life's challenges.

## The Cardinal Virtues

In Wisdomlic-Wæg the cardinal virtues play a central role in guiding practitioners towards a harmonious and fulfilling life. The term "cardinal" means "central" or "crucial", and these virtues are considered to be the foundation of moral character. The four cardinal virtues in Wisdomlic-Wæg are prudence, fortitude, justice, and temperance.

Prudence, also known as wisdom, refers to the ability to make sound judgments and to understand the world in a deep and meaningful way. In Wisdomlic-Wæg, prudence is seen as the foundation of all other virtues, as it allows one to understand the divine order and to live in accordance with it. The pursuit of prudence involves a lifelong process of learning and self-discovery.

Fortitude, or courage, refers to the ability to face adversity and to stand up for what is right, even in the face of danger or opposition. By cultivating fortitude, practitioners of Wisdomlic-Wæg seek to live with bravery and to have the strength to do what is right, even in difficult circumstances.

Justice, refers to the ability to act in a fair and moral manner, and to treat others with respect and dignity. By cultivating justice, practitioners of Wisdomlic-Wæg seek to live with fairness and integrity, and to act in a way that is in keeping with the values and principles of the path.

Temperance, or self-control, refers to the ability to control one's emotions, desires, and actions, and to avoid excess. By cultivating temperance, practitioners of Wisdomlic-Wæg seek to live with balance and moderation, and to avoid actions that may cause harm to themselves or others.

The cardinal virtues in Wisdomlic-Wæg are not seen as separate and distinct entities, but are instead interdependent and interconnected. The pursuit of the cardinal virtues is not a one-time effort, but is instead an ongoing process of self-discovery and growth, and practitioners are encouraged to reflect on their own experiences and to make an ongoing effort to cultivate these virtues in their daily lives.

In conclusion, the cardinal virtues play a central role in Wisdomlic-Wæg, guiding practitioners towards a harmonious and fulfilling life. By cultivating prudence, fortitude, justice, and temperance, practitioners seek to live in accordance with the divine order. Through the pursuit of these virtues, one can achieve personal growth and fulfillment and live a life that is in harmony with the divine order.

The dichotomy of control is closely tied to the idea of the divine order, which is central to the Wisdomlic-Wæg cosmology. The divine order is considered to be the underlying structure of the universe, and it is seen as governing all events, both those that are within our control and those that are not. By recognizing and accepting the divine order, practitioners of Wisdomlic-Wæg seek to live in harmony with the larger system and to cultivate a sense of peace and fulfillment.

The dichotomy of control is also closely linked to the Stoic philosophy that is part of the Wisdomlic-Wæg tradition. The Stoics believed that it is not events themselves that cause us stress and suffering, but rather our thoughts and reactions to them. By focusing on what is within our control and accepting what is not, practitioners of Wisdomlic-Wæg seek to cultivate a sense of calm and peace in the face of life's challenges.

In conclusion, the dichotomy of control is a central tenet of Wisdomlic-Wæg, and it provides practitioners with a framework for distinguishing between what is within their control and what is not. By focusing on their thoughts, feelings, and actions, and by accepting external circumstances with equanimity and peace, practitioners of Wisdomlic-Wæg seek to live in harmony with the divine order and to cultivate a harmonious and fulfilling life.

## Balance

Balance is a central concept in the Wisdomlic-Wæg philosophy. The concept of balance is seen as crucial for living a fulfilling life and achieving inner peace, and it is integrated into many aspects of the Wisdomlic-Wæg tradition.

One of the most important aspects of balance in Wisdomlic-Wæg is the idea of balancing the four cardinal virtues of prudence, fortitude, justice, and temperance. Each of these virtues represents a different aspect of life, and by cultivating all four, we can achieve a harmonious balance in our thoughts, feelings, and actions. Prudence, for example, helps us to make wise decisions and act in our best interests, while fortitude helps us to persevere in the face of adversity. Justice helps us to act fairly and treat others with kindness, while temperance helps us to maintain moderation and control our desires.

Another important aspect of balance in Wisdomlic-Wæg is the idea of balancing the dichotomy of control. This concept holds that there are two types of events in life: those that are within our control, and those that are not. By recognizing what is within our control and accepting what is not, we can maintain balance in our lives and avoid becoming overly attached to outcomes. This allows us to act in accordance with the divine order and shape our own destiny, while also avoiding feelings of frustration and disappointment when things don't go as planned.

In addition to balancing the cardinal virtues and the dichotomy of control, balance is also seen as important in other aspects of the Wisdomlic-Wæg tradition, such as its cosmology. In the Wisdomlic-Wæg cosmology, the universe is seen as a balance of opposing forces, such as light and dark, good and evil, and life and death. By maintaining balance in our own lives, we are seen as contributing to the balance of the universe and helping to maintain the divine order.

Balance is also seen as important in the Wisdomlic-Wæg concept of wyrd, or fate and destiny. By cultivating balance in our thoughts, feelings, and actions, we are seen as influencing our own wyrd and shaping our own destiny. At the same time, accepting the events that are beyond our control and maintaining a sense of balance is seen as crucial for living in harmony with the divine order and avoiding feelings of frustration and disappointment.

In conclusion, balance is a central concept in the Wisdomlic-Wæg philosophy, and it is seen as crucial for living a fulfilling life and achieving inner peace. By balancing the cardinal virtues, the dichotomy of control, and other aspects of the Wisdomlic-Wæg tradition, we can live in harmony with the divine order, shape our own destiny, and cultivate a sense of peace and fulfillment.

## Wyrd

Wyrd is a concept central to the Anglo-Saxon heathen tradition, and it is a key component of the Wisdomlic-Wæg philosophy. The word "wyrd" is often translated as "fate" or "destiny," but it is much more than that. In the Wisdomlic-Wæg tradition, wyrd encompasses the idea of the divine order, the underlying structure of the universe that governs all events and influences our lives.

Wyrd is seen as a web of threads that connect all things, both past, present, and future. This web of threads represents the interconnection of all events and the way that they influence each other, creating a pattern that is larger than any one individual. In the Wisdomlic-Wæg tradition, wyrd is considered to be an inescapable part of existence, and it is seen as the ultimate determinant of the course of our lives.

While wyrd is an inescapable part of existence, it is not seen as predetermined or unchangeable. Instead, the Wisdomlic-Wæg tradition teaches that we have the power to influence our own wyrd through our thoughts, feelings, and actions. By cultivating virtues such as prudence, fortitude, justice, and temperance, we can influence the direction of our lives and shape our own destiny.

At the same time, it is important to recognize that we cannot control everything, and that there are some events that are beyond our power to influence. The Wisdomlic-Wæg tradition teaches practitioners to accept these events with equanimity, recognizing that they are a part of the larger pattern of wyrd and the divine order. This acceptance is seen as a crucial part of living in harmony with the divine order and cultivating a sense of peace and fulfillment.

Wyrd is also closely tied to the idea of the dichotomy of control, which is central to the Wisdomlic-Wæg philosophy. The dichotomy of control holds that there are two types of events in life: those that are within our control, and those that are not. By recognizing what is within our control and accepting what is not, we can influence our own wyrd and shape our own destiny.

In conclusion, the concept of wyrd is a central part of the Wisdomlic-Wæg philosophy, and it encompasses the idea of the divine order, the interconnection of all events, and the ultimate determinant of the course of our lives. By cultivating virtues and accepting the events that are beyond our control with equanimity, we can influence our own wyrd and shape our own destiny, living in harmony with the divine order and cultivating a sense of peace and fulfillment.

## The Divine Order

The concept of the divine order is central to Wisdomlic-Wæg and encompasses the idea that the universe operates according to a set of inherent laws and principles that dictate the flow of events and the relationships between all things. The divine order is seen as the underlying structure of the universe and the source of balance and harmony.

In Wisdomlic-Wæg, the gods play a key role in maintaining the divine order. The gods are seen as beings of immense power and influence, who shape the course of events and influence the destinies of individuals and the universe as a whole. The gods are seen as guardians and caretakers of the divine order, and as such, they play a crucial role in ensuring that the balance of the universe is maintained.

In order to live in accordance with the divine order, individuals are encouraged to align their thoughts, feelings, and actions with the will of the gods. This is achieved by cultivating the cardinal virtues of prudence, fortitude, justice, and temperance and by embracing the concept of the dichotomy of control, recognizing what is within one's control and what is not, and accepting the events that are beyond one's control.

Reverence for the gods is also seen as an important aspect of Wisdomlic-Wæg, and individuals are encouraged to honor the gods through rituals, offerings, and devotion. By doing so, they demonstrate their commitment to living in accordance with the divine order and they acknowledge the role of the gods in maintaining the balance of the universe.

It is important to note that in Wisdomlic-Wæg, the gods are not seen as controlling the universe in a direct and absolute manner, but rather as guiding and shaping it in accordance with the laws of the divine order. The universe is seen as having its own inherent tendencies and forces, and the gods work to ensure that these forces are kept in balance and harmony.

In conclusion, the divine order and the role of the gods in its maintenance is a central aspect of Wisdomlic-Wæg. By aligning their thoughts, feelings, and actions with the divine order, individuals are able to live in harmony with the universe, contribute to its balance, and shape their own destiny. The gods play a crucial role in maintaining the divine order and ensuring that balance is maintained, and by showing reverence for the gods, individuals acknowledge their role and demonstrate their commitment to living in accordance with the divine order.

To properly show reverence, it is important to understand the will of the gods and the role they play in the world.

One way to determine the will of the gods is through divination. Divination is the practice of seeking knowledge or insight into the future or the unknown through various methods such as reading the omens in nature, casting runes, or using tarot cards. This practice can help one better understand the desires and intentions of the gods, and make offerings and offerings that are in line with their will.

Reverence for the gods and ancestors can also be shown through acts of devotion and worship. This can include offerings of food, drink, or other items, lighting candles or incense, or reciting prayers or invocations.
