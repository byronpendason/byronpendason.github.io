In classical philosophy (philosophies derived from Hellenist and Roman schools of thought), the cardinal virtues of prudence, justice, fortitude, and temperance are the virtues upon which all other virtues hinge.

> The cardinal virtues are four virtues of mind and character in both classical philosophy and Christian theology. They are prudence, justice, fortitude, and temperance. They form a virtue theory of ethics. The term cardinal comes from the Latin cardo (hinge); virtues are so called because they are regarded as the basic virtues required for a virtuous life.  
> Wikipedia: "The Cardinal Virtues"[^1]

All other virtues, according to this virtue theory of ethics, are derived from one or more of these virtues.

In Old English, the term *cardinal virtue* is translated as *heafod-mægen*[^2].

In *The Old English Boethius* we find the following:

> Wīsdōm is se hēhsta cræft, and se hæfþ on him feōwer oðre cræftas, ðara is ān wærscipe, ōðer gemetgung, þridde is ellen, feōrþe rihtwīsnes

([[Wisdom]] is the highest virtue, and has in it four other virtues, of which one is [[prudence]], another [[temperance]], the third is [[fortitude]], the fourth [[justice]].)

Modern English | Old English
---------------|------------
Wisdom | *Wīsdōm*
Prudence | *Wærscipe*
Temperance | *Metgung*
Fortitude | *Ellen*
Justice | *Rihtwisnes*

## Wisdom

Wisdom, in the Old English version of Boethius, translates the original's *Philosophy*, meaning *love of wisdom*. It is spelled the same in both Old English and modern English, but in Old English had a little more broad of a meaning: *wisdom, knowledge, learning, philosophy*. Here, it is the active seeking of wisdom, a lifestyle of trying to attain it through learning and virtuous living.

Boethius seems to create a clear hierarchy: The attainment of wisdom is the greatest virtue, and consists of the practice of the four cardinal virtues.

### Prudence

Prudence is living your life according to reason. It is careful consideration of one's actions to determine what is right and wrong. It is *practical wisdom*, helping the virtuous person to discern between that which is good and that which is harmful.

The Old English word is *wærscipe*, from the root *wær*, meaning *aware, wary, cautious*. Our actions should always be done with an awareness of all potential consequences. We should be wary of actions that will cause harm to ourselves (which would go against the virtue of *temperance*) or others (which would go against the virtue of *justice*). 

### Temperance

Temperance is self-restraint or self-discipline. It refers to moderation and self discipline. Anything taken to excess can become problematic. Eating too much, for example, can lead to several different health problems. How do we know when something has become to be too much? When it begins to harm us or others, it's probably crossed over from temperance to excessive. So, prudence is necessary here. Being mindful of the consequences of our actions is essential.

The Old English word is *metgung*, meaning *moderation, temperance*.

### Fortitude

Fortitude is being courageous in the face of adversity. It's doing the right thing even when it's hard. Again, prudence is important here, because there's a fine line between courage and recklessness. I think there's a couple different factors that go into determining whether an action would count as courageous or reckless. The most important considerations, in my opinion, is the following:

1. *Is this matter something that is within my control?* If it's not, then we are wasting our time and effort, and possibly putting ourselves in danger for no reason.
2. *Is this necessary?* Doing something risky that is not necessary is not fortitude. It's being reckless.
3. *Is there a way to accomplish this that is less risky?* To do something that is risky when there are less risky alternatives is foolishness and very reckless.
4. *Is this going to cause harm?* Ideally, all our actions will be harm-free. But we do not live in an ideal world, so sometimes harm is unavoidable. In this case, harm-reduction should be our top priority. This will be covered when we discuss Justice below.

We should never be afraid to do the right thing, but we should keep the above factors in mind when trying to determine what the right course of action is.

In Old English, the term for fortitude is *ellen*, It means *strength, courage, bravery*. It is the strength to do what is right.

### Justice

Justice is treating our fellow humans with fairness, dignity, and respect. We should strive to never do harm to other people. Sometimes harm is unavoidable, and when it is we should strive to cause the least amount of harm. Quality of harm should be considered along with the quantity. A theft that saves lives may be more virtuous than allowing the lives to be lost. Stealing food from a supermarket to feed starving children is better than letting them starve, but financial harm to the owners should be minimised by stealing a loaf of bread rather than expensive steaks. Of course, this should only be considered after all other options have been exhausted.

In Old English, the term is *rihtwisnes* which means *justice, fairness*. It is an ancestor to our modern word *righteousness*.

## Other Virtues

I am of the opinion that all virtues can boil down to the four cardinal virtues, either being an aspect of one of them or combination of them. For example, *generosity* is the self discipline (*temperance*) to give to the less fortunate (*justice*) instead of spending it on a luxury you don't need.

Due to the evolution of language (some words getting more specific over time, others getting more general), it can be hard to see how some virtues can tie back to one of the cardinal virtues with modern language. So it's probably a good thing to break them up for the non-philosophical types to be more specific on what is virtuous.
