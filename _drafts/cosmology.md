# Cosmology

The cosmology of Fyrnsidu has been reconstructed from what we know about the Anglo-Saxons combined with the common elements found in the mythologies of all the Indo-European cultures (Norse, Hindu, Roman, Greek, etc). Due to the wide dispersion of these groups, those elements found in all of them are likely to come from their common ancestor: Proto-Indo-European. We have anglicised the names to make it applicable to a spirituality based upon the Anglo-Saxons.

## Chaos

All Indo-European mythologies begin with the initial state of the universe prior to its creation being chaos. Chaos was a vast void of emptiness. Ovid tells us:

> a rude and undeveloped mass,
that nothing made except a ponderous weight;
and all discordant elements confused,
were there congested in a shapeless heap.[^1]

The ancient Norse called the chaos Ginnungugap (which may mean "magical (and creative) power-filled space"[^2]), and the Anglo-Saxons called it Gedwolma. It should be noted that this chaos is different from our modern concept of chaos, so we tend to refer to the earlier understanding of chaos as *cosmic chaos* to distinguish it from our modern understanding of chaos, which we call *mundane chaos*.

From Gedwolma emerged Gymm (pronounced like *yimm*, Old English cognate of *Ymir*), the father of the ettins and the gods.

## The Gods

The gods are known in Old English as the *Ēse* (the Old English cognate of the Old Norse *Æsir*). The Ēse were originally the children of Gymm who desired to bring order to the chaos. The rest of Gymm's children opposed this. A war broke out between the two groups, and the Ēse emerged victorious. During the fighting, Gymm was slain and the Ēse used his body to form the world.

The gods bringing order to the chaos was the creation of our universe. The gods continue to maintain the cosmic order to this day. Without the cosmic order, nothing that exists in our universe would be able to exist.

The ettins desire to return the universe to its initial state of cosmic chaos, and many of them remain in a constant state of war with the gods in order to do so.

## Wyrd

One of the most fundamental pieces of the cosmic order established by the gods is Wyrd. This is an Old English word that is usually translated as "fate". Unlike the fate of classical religion, though, Wyrd is much more fluid, constantly being shaped and re-shaped by the actions of gods and men alike. It is a vast web that permeates the entire universe and connects every sentient being with every other sentient being.

While the universe itself has a cosmic wyrd, each individual also has their own personal wyrd.
