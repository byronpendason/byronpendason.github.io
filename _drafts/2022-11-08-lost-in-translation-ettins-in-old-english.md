I came across a [blog post](https://ingwine.neocities.org/speechlore/oe_ettins.html) recently, alleging to reevaluate ettins in Old English literature. I read it with interest, because I've interacted with the author on various Discord servers and have had nothing but positive experiences with them. The argument in this case, though, falls flat. It takes every instance in Old English literature that is translated as *giant* in modern English, and declares it to be talking about ettins. This reflects a problem that is all too prevalent in the modern era, the conflating of all giants in Old English literature. But not every giant in Old English literature is an ettin.

There are four words in Old English that are translated as *giant* in modern English. There is *eoten* (which is cognate to the Norse Jötunn), *ent*, *þyrs*, and *gigant*. Only the first is the ancestor of the modern English word *ettin*. The last is a Latin loanword (which ultimately descends from the Greek) that ended up replacing the other three before we get to the modern era. This is the reason, I believe that confusion between the different types of giants exist.

In [another blog post](https://www.minewyrtruman.com/2022/09/18/giants-in-fyrnsidu/) I give my attempt at building giant-lore in Fyrnsidu, but for this blog post I want to focus on academic sources and not my own lore-building. As I say in the footer of every single page on this website, I'm not an expert or academic, so double check everything I say. At the end of this blog post, you will find a list of the sources I used so that you can.

## Exploring Giants in Anglo-Saxon lore

Let's start with the survivals in folklore. There's an English/Scottish fairy tale called [The Red Ettin](1https://en.m.wikisource.org/wiki/English_Fairy_Tales/The_Red_Ettin), collected by Joseph Jacobs in 1890. The titular character in this tale is a monstrous giant with three heads who kidnaps women, turns men to stone and alludes to eating people. In the Northumbrian dialect of English, an *ettin* is another word for a *boggle*, according to *Northumberland Words* by Richard Oliver Heslop (pg 268). In the same book's entry for *boggle* (pg 73), we find:

> The boggle is always a personality, having a proper name, and haunting a certain spot; and there is small doubt that his existence is the relic of an older faith. "This old Northland mythology, I find," says Carlyle, "to be the impersonation of the visible workings of nature. The dark hostile powers of nature they figure to themselves as 'Jötuns,' giants, huge shaggy beings of a demoniac character. The empire of this Universe is divided between these two; they dwell apart, in perennial internecine feud. The Gods dwell above in Asgard, the garden of the Asen or Divinities; Yötunheim, a distant dark chaotic land, is the home of the Jötuns. (Carlyle's Heroes and Hero Worship.)

The word *boggle* is the origin of the word for the word *bogeyman*. So, that should give you an idea of what an ettin would be to the people of Northumberland.

The classic example of ettins, of course, is Grendel and his mother. Grendel was an ettin who lives alone with his mother in the swamplands near Hrothgar's Hall. Being annoyed by the noise of civilization, he inflicts a twelve year long bloody era of horror upon Hrothgar's people. Slain by Beowulf with his bare hands, Grendel's mother ventures out to exact vengeance. Beowulf tracks her back to her lair, and uses an ancient sword he finds there to slay the female ettin.

Add these figures (the red ettin, bogeyman, grendel, and his mother) together, and we do not get a positive impression of ettins. People who've been in Heathenry for a while might want to stop me here and ask about Wada, the father of Wayland. As far as I am aware, he's never identified as an ettin specifically, only as a giant. People make a leap of logic from there to declare him an ettin, but not all giants are ettins. (The same argument is sometimes made for Wōden based upon Mercury the Giant. But in *Solomon and Saturn*, the OE word used for Wōden is *gigant*, not *eoten*.)

The author of the blog post I mentioned in the introductory paragraph did attempt an argument for equating ettins and ents. In line 1557 of *Beowulf*, our titular character finds an old ettin-ish (*eotenisc*) sword. It's called here a work of giants (*giganta geweorc*). When it's presented to Hrothgar in line 1679, it's called an ancient work of ents (*enta ærgeweork*). (The author of the blog post incorrectly translates the giants/ents in those phrases as adjectives, but in Old English the -*a* ending denotes a genitive plural noun.) Based upon this, the author claims that the ettins, entas, and gigantas are all the same. But let's examine these words a bit more.

Pollington tells us, "the word *ent* is used to gloss the Greek *gigas* and Latin *gigant*" (*The Elder Gods*, pg. 293). So it being referred to as a *giganta* work in the first instance and *enta* work in the second is no surprise. A literal translation of the first is *work of giants*, and the second is *ancient work of ents*. Ent and gigant are clearly meant to be equivalents. But what about it being called an old ettin-ish sword when it's introduced? The adjective used here (*eotenisc*) is modifying the noun *ealdsweord*, "old sword". In the other two cases mentioned, the words (*giganta* and *enta*) are genitive plural nouns (despite the fact that the author of the above mentioned blog post mistranslates them as adjectives). It means that the ettin-ish sword was crafted by entas/gigantas. What does the sword being ettin-ish mean?

According to Pollington, "The adjective *eotenisc* is 'gigantic' or simply 'supernatural' when it describes the sword Beowulf finds in the cave of Grendel's mother" (*The Elder Gods*, pg 296). This makes sense, as the OE ending -*isc* is equivalent to the modern English -*ish*. It's definition is "a suffix of adjectives, connoting the quality of the object denoted by the stem" (*A Compendious Anglo-Saxon and English dictionary*, by Joseph Bosworth). In other words, *eotenisc* means that it has some quality of ettins, it's in some way ettin-like.

According to the same dictionary, *eotinisc* means "Belonging to or made by a giant, giant". So another possibility is that it's called an ettin-ish sword because it was owned by an ettin, Grendel's mother. While it *could* mean it was made by an ettin, we have no other sources that indicate that ettins had produced anything generally thought of as man-made, only geographical features.

This argument- that the sword being called giant-ish, ent-ish, and ettin-ish means that all three are the same thing- is the lynch pin of his entire post. Without it, it completely falls apart. And fall apart it does, once one realizes that it's not only a false equivalency but based upon a mistranslation.

## A Lexicon for Giant-lore

I highly recommend *The Elder Gods* relevant sections on Entas, Eotenas, Gigantas, and Grendel & his mother (pg. 293ff), but I will briefly summarise the ideas he presents here. The **ents** (*entas*) are an ancient race of giants, known for construction of buildings and the creation of weapons and armour. From the examples we are given (for example, the nephilim, Nimrod, Goliath, and Hercules), we can surmise that they are at least part human and have human appearance. They are not opposed to humanity, and are not necessarily dangerous to humans (though they can be if provoked, just like any other beings). The **gigantas** appear to originally be a gloss of ents, but ended up becoming the word for giants in general, completely replacing the other three words by modern times. The **ettins** (*eotenas*) are another ancient race of giants, kinsmen of the gods but are not allied with them. Many directly oppose the gods. From the examples we have of ettins (Grendel, his mother, the red ettin), it can be surmised that they are monstrous. If we go with Norse sources, some of the female Jötnar are beautiful enough to attract the attention of the gods, but the Norse understood they are understood to be shape shifters so they can look however they choose. The word *eotenas* is related to the word meaning *to eat*, and this could be a reference to how the corpus and folklore has them being human-eaters. The **thyrs** (*þyrsas*) appear to be lonely swamp-dwellers (they live alone in the fen, according to *Maxims II*) and were apparently known for their appetites. Beowulf indicates that there's at least some overlap between the ettins and the thyrs.
