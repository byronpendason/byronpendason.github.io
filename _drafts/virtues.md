Historical heathenry does not have a codified system of ethics. Due to the overall unification of their religious and social systems, ethics in historical heathenry seem to have been primarily culturally based. Furthermore, Germanic society was not a monolith so there were differences across time and location. And yet, heathens modernly have found a deep need for integrating ethics into heathenry. 

Because of the need modern groups have found for ethics within their religious system, various modern heathen groups have tried to create an ethical system for themselves. Most of those systems tend to be based upon virtue ethics, the development of a moral character of excellence by focusing on a list of virtues. This development of one's moral character is generally obtained by reflecting on their actions, determining where they failed to live up to their virtues, and resolving to do better in the future. While there are many virtues, virtue ethics tend to focus in on a list of them that, when mastered, leads to a virtuous character.

We at Fyrnsidu.faith have also felt the need for ethics within religion and have channeled that need into the creation of this list of twelve virtues. The following list is made up of concepts important to the Anglo-Saxon peoples and has been gleaned from Anglo-Saxon sources. These virtues, in our opinion, best reflect the cultural values of the Anglo-Saxons that we should emulate. We took care in choosing the Old English word that best translates each, and choosing a quote from Anglo-Saxon sources that conceptualize that trait.

## Calmness - *Smyltness*
> One should not be too soon fearful nor too soon joyful. (Durham Proverbs 23)

Calmness is the ability to resist strong emotion in order to have one's mind at peace.

## Courage - *Ellen*

Courage is the ability and willingness to confront dangers or pain or fears, obstacles both physical and mental, to do what needs to be done.

## Generosity - *Gifolness*
> Wealth is a comfort to all men;
> yet must every man bestow it freely,
> if he wish to gain honour in the sight of his lord. (Old English Rune Poem, "Feoh")

Generosity is freely sharing what is yours with others.

Moderation is the ability and willingness to avoid excesses in life and to regulate oneself away from extremes in behavior.

## Patience - *Geþyld*
> Patience is half of happiness. (Durham Proverbs 1)

Patience is the ability to not be hasty or rash and to be able to withstand trials and difficulties while maintaining composure.

## Piety - *Ærfæstnys*
> Blotmonath is ‘‘month of immolations’’, for then the cattle which were to be slaughtered were consecrated to their gods. (The Reckoning of Time, chapter 15)

Piety is the observation of one’s duty to that which they hold to be sacred and devotion to one's divine beings – be they gods, ancestors, or wights.

Prudence is the ability to use caution and reason to avoid troubles when possible.

## Reciprocity - *Wrixl*

Reciprocity is the ideal in which one does not seek to maintain one-sided relationships but instead maintains relationships in which both sides give to one another. 

## Steadfastness - *Stedefæstness*
> Do not betray a dear friend, but always hold to the right way. (Precepts 29-30)

Steadfastness is being unwavering in your loyalty to your ways, your beliefs, your morals, and to the people you love.

## Truthfulness - *Soðfæstnes*
> Always have truth as your goal, whatever you say. (Precepts 64)

Truthfulness is the quality of being honest and true.

## Wisdom - *Wisdom*
> So this earth declines and falls, every single day; And so a man cannot become wise before he has his share of winters in the world. A wise person should be patient, should not be too hot-hearted, nor too hasty with words, neither too weak a warrior, nor too reckless, neither too fearful, nor too quick to rejoice, nor too greedy, nor ever too eager to boast before he knows for sure. (The Wanderer 62-9)

Wisdom is a quality that is cultivated in a person over the course of a lifetime; it is using your accumulated knowledge and being informed by the qualities of calmness, courage, generosity, justice moderation, patience, piety, prudence, reciprocity, steadfastness, and truthfulness to do the right thing.
