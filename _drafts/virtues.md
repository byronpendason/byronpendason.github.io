Heathenry doesn't have a codified system of ethics, but most systems tend to be based upon *virtue ethics*, the development of a moral character of excellence by focusing on a list of virtues. This development of one's moral character is generally obtained by reflecting on their actions, determining where they failed to live up to their virtues, and resolving to do better in the future. The authors of this website have gleaned the following virtues from Anglo-Saxon sources, choosing the Old English word that best translates each, and choosing a quote from Anglo-Saxon sources that conceptualise that virtue.

## Calmness - *Smyltness*
> One should not be too soon fearful nor too soon joyful. (Durham Proverbs 23)

Calmness is the resisting of strong emotion in order to have peace of mind.

## Courage - *Ellen*
> Train yourself for the better way, ever with courage as long as you live. (Precepts 7-8)

Courage is the willingness to confront dangers (physical and/or mental) to do what's right.

## Generosity - *Gifolness*
> Wealth is a comfort to all men;
> yet must every man bestow it freely,
> if he wish to gain honour in the sight of his lord. (Old English Rune Poem, "Feoh")

Generosity is sharing what's your's with others.

## Justice - *Rihtwisnes*
> Wise men guard their souls, uphold their integrity with justice. (Maxims I 36)

Justice is the concept of treating others with fairness.

## Moderation - *Metgung*
> Every man should act with moderation both to friends and foes. (Seafarer 111-12)

Moderation is the elimination of extremes.

## Patience - *Geþyld*
> Patience is half of happiness. (Durham Proverbs 1)

Patience is the endurance of difficult situations.

## Piety - *Ærfæstnys*
> Blotmonath is ‘‘month of immolations’’, for then the cattle which were to be slaughtered were consecrated to their gods. (The Reckoning of Time, chapter 15)

Piety is devotion to one's divine beings (for example, to the gods, one's ancestors, and the land wights).

## Prudence - *Wærscipe*
> A man should be firm in wisdom and moderate, prudent in mind. (Precepts 86-7)

Prudence is the ability to govern oneself by the use of reason.

## Reciprocity - *Wrixl*
> One treasure deserves another; gold should be given away. (Maxims I 155-4)

Reciprocity is the repayment of another's actions towards oneself (for example, giving another a gift in response to something they did for you).

## Steadfastness - *Stedefæstness*
> Do not betray a dear friend, but always hold to the right way. (Precepts 29-30)

Steadfastness is being unwavering in your loyalty to your ways and the people you love.

## Truthfulness - *Soðfæstnes*
> Always have truth as your goal, whatever you say. (Precepts 64)

Truthfulness is the quality of being honest.

## Wisdom - *Wisdom*
> So this earth declines and falls, every single day; And so a man cannot become wise before he has his share of winters in the world. A wise person should be patient, should not be too hot-hearted, nor too hasty with words, neither too weak a warrior, nor too reckless, neither too fearful, nor too quick to rejoice, nor too greedy, nor ever too eager to boast before he knows for sure. (The Wanderer 62-9)

Wisdom is knowing the right thing to do based upon past experiences.
