This is an incomplete rough draft of an original story written by me. It's a mix of historical fact, historical suppositions, artistic license, and the UPG of myself and other Fyrnsideras. I hope you enjoy it!

# Act I

The mead hall of Coenwalh was loud, way too loud. Penda adored his older brother, but he did not enjoy the rambunctious parties his brother held every night.

"Have another ale, my friend, and rid your face of that grimace," said a thick Welsh accent.

Penda smiled weakly at his friend Cadwallon. "A party on occasion is wonderful, but you're not here every night to endure the endless drama."

Cadwallon took a deep swig of his ale. "If your ealdormen had chosen your brother to be king instead of your uncle Cearl, he wouldn't have time for endless partying."

"Do not mention that puppet in my presence!" snarled Coenwalh, clearly having had too much to drink, "If I were the king, we wouldn't be servants to the Northumbrians! The wealth of Mercia would remain in Mercia, instead of being sent as tribute to that traitor's father in law Edwin."

Penda rolled his eyes, as their brother Eowa spoke up. "Come now, brother, you must be more careful what you say. Our dearest uncle has his spies everywhere. If he were to catch word of you speaking like that, I would be inheriting this fine mead hall from you."

"If it wasn't for Cearl, King Edwin of Northumbria would have conquered Mercia and all the sons of Pybba would have been executed years ago!"

Every head in the mead hall turned towards Oswald, glaring. "We are descendants of Icel the Great!" Penda exclaimed, "Wōden would have given us the victory over those Christians! Northumbria would be bowing the knee to us!"

"Get out!" Coenwalh said sternly to Oswald, "If I ever see you again, I will tear you apart limb by limb with my bare hands."

Eowa spoke up, "Now brother, there is no need to-"

"*I said get out of here!*" Coenwalh roared, jumping to his feet and grabbing his father Pybba's sword from above the hearth.

By the time Coenwalh had turned back around to face Oswald, Cearl's defender was gone. "There goes our only chance of Cearl not hearing about this," Penda sighed.

* * *

"You're not happy here," Cadwallon said to Penda, "Come back with me and spend some time among your mother's people."

It was the next morning, and Penda's Welsh friend was preparing to depart for home.

"Any other time, I may have taken you up on that," Penda replied, "But after last night's events, I need to head back to the royal court and try to smooth things over with my uncle."

"Why grovel to that spineless coward?" Cadwallon snickered, "If he dared to move against the sons of Pybba, the people of Mercia would rise up against him. And the kingdom of Gwynedd would not stand for such an offense against the sons of their most favoured daughter!"

"I know the sons of my father shall regain the throne of Mercia, but I'm not sure that provoking a war is the way to do it. The ealdormen who placed Cearl upon the throne are not happy with his grovelling to Edwin. They're sure to choose one of Pybba's sons as the next king, we just have to survive my eldest brother's foolishness until then."

Cadwallon sighed. "I just have this feeling that bad things will befall you if you stay in Mercia."

"I have a feeling you're right, my friend, but duty to one's family must always come first, even before one's own well-being. This is the way of my people."

"Just be careful, Penda. Seventeen winters is far too young to be on your king's bad side."

Penda smiled at him, "My gods go with me, just as surely as your god goes with you."

After Cadwallon departed back for his home, Penda entered to find his brothers fighting.

"We owe that traitor nothing!" Coenwalh declared.

"Be that as it may," Eowa replied, "We *do* owe our father a legacy. Which we cannot provide if we provoke our uncle into extinguishing Pybba's line!"

"Do not worry about Cearl," Penda said, "I shall be leaving by noon to head to his court and smooth this incident over."

Coenwalh snorted. "I say-"

"You have clearly said enough already!" Penda retorted, before turning to head to his room to begin gathering his things.

* * *

"Are you sure this is a good idea?" 

Penda sighed. "Eowa, you know this isn't the first time Coenwalh has spoken evil of Cearl. Cearl is usually pretty angry about it, but all it takes is reminding him about his love for his brother. This time will be no different."

"This time may be different. Our eldest brother did more than just speak evil of the king. He was ready to kill a man for defending the king. Threatened to tear him limb from limb."

"I know. Which is why it's all the more important that we calm our uncle, before he sends an army after us and burns our mead hall to the ground."

"Let me go with you," Eowa pleaded.

"And leave our brother unsupervised and to his own devices? He's liable to be fermenting a rebellion before we return!"

Eowa burst into laughter. "Yeah, I can see that happening. Better I stay to keep him under control."

The brothers embraced one another. "Take care, young Penda. May the gods go with you."

"They always do, my brother. They always do."

* * *

The sun was setting when Penda came to a swamp. He briefly considered making camp outside the swamp and staying there until morning. Although he had gone through this swamp many times, it had never been at night.

"No," Penda said to himself, "I must hurry on to the king's palace, and the sooner that I get there the better."

As soon as the sun was gone, the swamp was filled with an unnatural silence. Penda could only hear the splashing of his own footsteps. Then something hit him from behind, sending him flying several feet.

Penda rose to his feet cautiously, looking around to see what had hit him. He saw a beast in the form of a human, but twice as big, with skin that looked like stone covered with splotches of moss.

"Who are you, that you dare invade *my* home?" the creature asked angrily.

"I am Penda, the son of Pybba, and the trespassing was not intentional. I'm just trying to make my way to my uncle's place."

"Pybba... Pybba.... Why does that name sound familiar?" the monster wondered aloud.

"He was the previous king of Mercia," Penda answered.

"Oh, yes! The Anglian king who fell in love with a Welsh princess, thereby making his subjects unable to trust his half breed sons with the throne!"

Penda drew his seax from his cloak, and pointed it at the monster.

The monster began to laugh. "I am an ettin, one of the first sons of Gymm! My skin cannot be pierced by any human-made weapon."

Penda just smiled. "This seax is no human sword; it was forged by Wayland the Smith for my ancestor Icel!"

Penda lunged at the ettin and brought his sword to land hard on the ettin's skin. This made the ettin bellow out in pain. He smacked Penda with his huge hand, again sending Penda flying several feet.

"*I should kill you for that!*" shouted the ettin, "But I think that would be too merciful on you. Instead, death shall follow you for the rest of your life! No one around you shall ever be safe."

And then the ettin disappeared, leaving Penda alone.

# Act II

On the opposite side of the swamp was a small town. Like the swamp, Penda had been through this town many times. But always during the day.

It was a couple hours after sunset when Penda made it to the town. Like the swamp, it was unnaturally quiet. Penda went up to the building that he knew was the mead hall and the residence of the local thegn, and he knocked on the door.

Whenever Penda had passed through this town before, he had always thought it strange that the thegn always seemed to be hosting a party in the afternoon. Now, Penda thought it was even more strange that this soon after sunset, it was like a ghost town.

Penda again knocked on the door, and it slowly crept open to the point where someone could peek out.

Then the door opened up all the way, and Penda was pulled inside before the door was quickly shut again.

"What is going on?" Penda asked.

"Please, be quiet, lord Penda!" whispered the thegn urgently, "We do not want the ettin from the swamp to hear us!"

"What is going on?" Penda again tried asking, this time in a whisper.

"Please, just lay down and sleep. We can talk in the morning!"

Penda found an empty cot and laid down, but sleep would not come. As his eyes adjusted to the darkness, he saw cots all over the floor of the mead hall, most with a person in it. It looked like the entire town was inside the mead hall, laying on the floor.

At some point he must have fallen asleep, because he woke up to screaming. There was a trail of bloody corpses leading outside.

Penda jumped to his feet, grabbed Icel's seax and ran outside. In the distance, he saw the ettin. He was smiling at Penda, blood dripping from his mouth and claws. With his seax drawn, Penda charged the ettin.

The ettin was gone by the time Penda reached where the ettin had been.

"It had many years since the last ettin attack," the voice of the thegn came from behind him, "Ever since we began doing this every night."

Penda turned around to face the thegn. "I'm so sorry."

The thegn smiled weakly, "At least it wasn't as bad as the last time. Only half a dozen people were killed, and there was no great fire this time."

"I swear to you, I shall kill this ettin and get revenge for the lives lost this night."

The thegn looked skeptical, but Penda did not notice this. "What can you tell me about this ettin?"

"Only that he's been in that swamp since before your father gave me this town. The people here told me about him when I arrived, that he attacked every full moon. We tried many things to stop his attacks, but nothing worked until we started huddling together in the mead hall every night."

The thegn was silent for a moment, as if considering his next words carefully. He hesitantly said, "Deep in the woods to the south of town, there is an old witch's hut. It is said that the witch has been there since before I've even been alive. She may know more about this ettin."

"Then that's where I shall go!" Penda declared.

* * *

With Sunne's first rays, Penda set off for the witch's hut. It was an uneventful trip, and he made it to the hut at about noon. He walked up to the door, and gave it three hard knocks. The door swung open, as of it's own accord."

"Penda," came a voice from within, "The son of Pybba, the future king of Mercia, hail!"

*Future king of Mercia?* Penda thought, *She's either sucking up, or she's insane!*

"Are you going to come in, or are you just going to stand out there questioning my sanity?"

Penda stepped into the doorway, and looked around. He thought of his father's words, *Enter every strange doorway carefully, observe what's inside before entering. You never know what enemy could be hiding there.*

"A wise man, King Pybba was," the witch said, "Does my humble abode pass your test?"

"So now you're reading my thoughts?" Penda asked.

"I've been having dreams these last several weeks," the witch replied, "I've seen much of your life, and even some of your futures. With that kind of knowledge, reading your thoughts from your body language is child's play!"

"My futures?" Penda asked incredulously, "As in more than one?"

"Many futures lie before you. Not even the Wyrd Sisters know for sure which one you will choose, until you choose it. Whatever you do, you cannot let yourself die before you take the throne. Otherwise, Edwin shall unite all the English kingdoms. And it is far too early for an united England."

The confused look on Penda's face spoke volumes to the witch. "Never mind," she said, "Just make sure you don't die before Edwin. I know the questions you're wanting to ask, but I will humour you and allow you to ask them. *After* you come in."

Penda entered the hut. "What do you know about the ettin in the swamp that terrorises the town on the swamp's edge?"

"His name is Wāse," the witch replied, "Would you like me to tell you about him, or *show* you his story?"

"What do you mean, *show* me?"

The witch smiled. She walked over to an altar, and walked to the other side of it. She beckoned him to approach, and he did. Between them was a metal bowl with a fire inside. "Stare into the fire," she commanded, "Don't blink or look away!"

She picked up some powder, and tossed it into the fire. The fire cackled, and sparks jumped towards Penda. He did not look away or flinch, and the sparks died before reaching him.

"In the beginning," the witch said, "There was only chaos! The building blocks for everything in the universe existed in the chaos, but could not take any form.

"From the chaos emerged Gymm, the father of the ettins and the father of the gods. Gymm fed himself from the teets of a cow that had emerged with him, and then laid down and slept "

Penda saw a human-like form emerge from nothingness, along with a cow. After drinking of the cow's milk, the human form laid down.

As the witch continued her story, the forms Penda saw in the fire acted out her words. "As he slept, beings began to emerge from Gymm's armpits and thighs. Most of these beings reveled in the chaos, these were the ettins. But some of them wanted to form order from the chaos. These were the gods.

"The gods tried to bring order to the chaos, but the ettins refused to allow them to. 'We must await until father Gymm awakens,' the ettins said. But the father would only awaken for a long enough time to feed from the cow, and then immediately fall back asleep, and more chaotic beings would emerge from his sleeping body. The gods, unable to get permission from father Gymm, rose up and slew the father of the ettins and the father of the gods."

Penda watched a few of the figures that emerged from Gymm kill their father.

"This sparked a war between the ettins and the gods, but the gods emerged victorious and the ettins were dispersed, thanks to the tactical knowledge of Tīw and the wisdom of Wōden. Never again would the ettins be an united force to threaten the gods, but they would always be a threat to mankind."

Penda's eyes had begun to burn from not blinking, but he gritted his teeth and continued to stare into the fire.

"From the body of Gymm, the gods formed our world Middengeard. The ettins never forgot the betrayal of the gods. Many decided to come to our world in order to sow chaos, in order to try to sink the world back into the chaos from which it came."

The scene before Penda changed to the swamp Penda had just visited the previous night, and there he saw himself confronting Wāse.

Penda could not keep himself from blinking any longer, and just like that, the scene in the fire vanished.

The witch clapped in delight. "Very impressive, son of Pybba! I've never seen anyone hold out that long."

"What I need to know is, how do I kill this ettin?"

The witch walked over to a table with many things on it. She rifled through the things there and picked up a chainmail tunic. "At the behest of Wōden, I've been working on this for several weeks. The enchantments I've placed on it should render it impenetrable to his claws. But every hit on it, regardless of the source of that hit, will weaken the enchantments until, eventually, the enchantments will fail completely. This, along with Icel's seax, should give you everything you need to fight Wāse and emerge victorious!"

Penda took the tunic and examined it. Several subtle runic-like symbols were all over it, painted in only a slightly darker shade of gray than the tunic itself. "What do you mean, it *should* make it impenetrable?" Penda asked.

"I couldn't test it without weakening the enchantments," the witch replied, "But I have complete faith in the magics given to me by Wōden, and divination has confirmed everything is as it should be."

"Very well," Penda said, "I shall have faith in your faith."

"One last thing," the witch said, "Be sure to go alone when you face the ettin. Anyone else with you will only be in harm's way, and death will be the result."

After Penda left the witch's hut, she transformed from an old hag into a beautiful, youthful woman. "Very impressive performance, Hrethe!" a voice said from behind her.

Hrethe turned to face Wōden, the god of sorcery. "We have done all that we can. It's in his hands now."

* * *

Penda made camp halfway between the witch's hut and the town, and stayed the night there. He did not want more people to die at the ettin's claws.

He awoke with Sunne's first rays, and saw that his camp had been completely trashed. He sighed in annoyance, but was glad that at least there was no death. He finished his journey back to town. The first person he saw said, "Quick, into the mead hall! It's not safe for you out in the open!"

This confused Penda. It was mid-morning, and ettins were nocturnal creatures. They cowered in their dens during the day, for the daylight sky was the domain of the sky father Tīw, who would alert their most feared enemy Thunor of their presence.

Nonetheless, Penda complied with the townsman. When he entered the mead hall, he not only saw the thegn but also his brothers Coenwalh and Eowa. "What are you guys doing here?" Penda asked.

Eowa stepped forward, "We've been declared outlaws by the king. A messenger was able to warn us, and we got away before an army descended upon our home."

"It's been burned to the ground," Coenwalh announced.

"Out of loyalty to your father, you will always have a safe haven here!" the thegn declared, "Please, just try to stay hidden. My men would be no match for the king's army."

"We would surrender ourselves before we let them harm you or your town," Coenwalh assured the thegn.

Eowa and Penda agreed wholeheartedly.

"I will be leaving before sunset anyways," Penda told them.

"Where will you go?" Eowa asked.

"To the swamp," answered Penda, 'There's an ettin who resides there who needs to be slain."

"We will go with you!" Coenwalh declared.

"No! The witch was explicit that I need to face this ettin alone. Anyone else will only be a liability."

* * *

When Sunne disappeared over the horizon, Penda was already where he had first met the ettin. "Wāse! I know you're here, come out and face me."

"Back for more, half-breed? And still alone, I see."

"This is between you and me. Let's finish this!"

"But he's not alone!" came the voice of Coenwalh behind him, "The sons of Pybba stand together!"

Penda spun around and looked at his two brothers in horror. "I told you to stay in the town!"

"More half-breeds to kill!" Wāse declared with joy. He charged Penda and with his claws slashed at him.

When his claws met the enchanted chainmail tunic, Wāse bellowed out in pain. Penda took the chance provided him and sunk his seax into the ettins gut.

Coenwalh saw an opportunity, and began to charge the monster with his father's sword held high.

Wāse pulled the seax out of his gut and threw it. There was a grunt from Coenwalh as the seax sank into his chest. Penda caught him as Coenwalh fell to the ground and the ettin ran away.

"This is not your fault," Coenwalh managed to get out through laboured breathing, "So don't... blame yourself brother. ... You've been... the best... of Pybba's sons. ... He... would be... proud... of you."

The life left Coenwalh as soon as he finished saying these words.

* * *

# Act III

Penda stared into the flames of the funeral pyre. In the flames, he kept seeing that fateful moment when his own seax slew his brother, and hearing the final words of the eldest son of Pybba. 

"He may have had his flaws," Cadwallon told him, "But Coenwalh was a great man that shall not be forgotten anytime soon."

Penda could not respond to him. He just continued to stare into the flames.

Word of Coenwalh's death had spread quickly. For days, warriors had been showing up, wanting to be at the funeral to pay their respects to the eldest son of Pybba. Cadwallon and several Welsh warriors had shown up first. Then warriors from all over Mercia began to appear. Even warriors from Wessex, where their sister was married to the king, had shown up to pay their respects.

Cadwallon had declared his loyalty to the house of Pybba, and placed his warriors under the command of the brothers. The warriors from Wessex had passed on a message from their king that while he couldn't put his kingdom into a war, the warriors he had sent were at their command. Every warrior from Mercia who had shown up, had declared their fealty to the sons of Pybba.

Eowa had been busy planning the downfall of Cearl, but Penda could not focus on anything. His mind kept playing those final moments of his eldest brother. Coenwalh had told him not to blame himself, but he couldn't help it.

"I tried to warn him," Penda told his best friend, "I should have specified exactly what the witch had said, and made it crystal clear why I needed to go alone."

"Your brother loved you," Cadwallon replied, "That love motivated him to be at your side. Do not fault him for that."

The emotions that Penda had been holding in came flooding out as he began to weep for his brother's loss.

Eowa was busy scanning the perimeter of the woods, diligently watching for the ettin. Penda had spent every night since the death of Coenwalh in the swamp, trying to coax out Wāse, to no avail. Tonight, however, Penda couldn't stay away. He needed to be here for his brother's funeral, so Eowa had assured him he would keep watch.

Eowa was hopeful that the swamp ettin had been mortally wounded, but Penda knew better. Penda was sure the ettin was just tending his wounds and would be back when he was back at full strength.

For two more weeks, Penda spent every night in the swamp. He finally gave up though, and rejoined Eowa's army as they toured the countryside of Mercia, staying one step ahead of Cearl as their army continued to grow.

* * *

Three months after the death of Coenwalh, Penda once again woke up to screaming. Knowing exactly what this meant, Penda grabbed his seax and rushed out of the tent. Wāse was there, thrashing around the body of a screaming warrior.

"Drop him Wāse," Penda commanded, "This is between me and you. Let's finish this!"

Wāse threw the warrior, knocking over the tree the warrior hit.

"My thoughts exactly!" snarled Wāse, and he charged Penda.

Penda side stepped the ettin, bringing his seax down into the monster's back. Wāse bellowed out in pain as slime-like blood oozed from the wound.

"Are you going to once again flee as a coward when wounded?" Penda asked.

The ettin turned to face Penda, straightening up to his full height. "No," Wāse answered, "This ends here tonight, with one of us dying here."

"You will die just like your father Gymm," Penda declared, "Perhaps I will build my castle from *your* corpse!"

Wāse roared in anger, and again he charged. He gut checked Penda with his shoulder, sending the young warrior flying. Wāse bellowed in pain from where his shoulder had made contact with Penda's chainmail.

As soon as Penda landed, he jumped to his feet. "Is that all you got?"

This time, Penda charged the ettin. Wāse swung his claws at Penda, but Penda ducked underneath the massive arm and jabbed his seax into Wāse's side.

"This isn't over!" Wāse shouted as he turned to flee.

Penda wasn't going to allow the ettin to get away once again. He jumped onto the ettin's back and sank his seax into Wāse's neck as more slime-like blood oozed from around the knife.

Wāse desperately tried shaking the young warrior off his back as he tried to flee, but Penda held on tight. He lifted his blade and sunk it into Wāse's shoulder.

The bellows of pain had brought out all the warriors, who watched the battle in stunned silence.

Again, Penda lifted his blade and brought it down into another part of Wāse's neck. This he did several times until at last the ettin fell.

Penda stood up over the beast, and decapitated him. He grabbed the head and lifted it high. The entire camp began to cheer, as Cadwallon and Eowa ran up to Penda.

"That was the greatest fight I've ever seen!" Cadwallon exclaimed.

"All hail Penda, the son of Pybba!" Eowa declared, "The greatest warrior to ever arise in Britain, and the future king of Mercia!"

Eowa fell to one knee, bowing his head to Penda. All the warriors from Mercia followed suit, and all the warriors from Wessex and Gwynned began to cheer and applaud.

THE END  
(Maybe? Let me know what you think in the comments below!)
