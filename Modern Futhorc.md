# The Modern Futhorc
## A Proposal for Writing Modern English in the Anglo-Saxon Runes 
### By Byron Pendason

## Introduction

In this document, I will lay out my system for writing modern English in the Futhorc, or Anglo-Saxon runes. 

The Futhorc was the original alphabet of English in the earliest days of Old English. There are challenges when writing modern English into runes, and in this document I seek to overcome those challenges. The first challenge is that alphabets in the early Medieval period were written phonetically, whereas modern English uses standardized spelling the defies writing phonetically. The biggest drawback of writing phonetically is that there are dozens, if not hundreds, of dialects in modern English. If you want to communicate with others, this can present a challenge. There are also sounds in modern English that have no correlation to sounds in Old English, so they have no runic equivalent. 

My system for writing in the Futhorc seeks to overcome these challenges by attempting to reverse engineer the transition from Futhorc to the Latin alphabet with the conversion to Christianity. This transition resulted in a near 1 to 1 correlation between runes and Latin letters. Essentially, they transliterated their runes into Latin letters. My proposal is to do the opposite, and transliterate modern English into Futhorc runes. This will use a 1 to 1 correlation of runes to letters, with the exception of digraphs, which is when a single rune corresponds to double letter combination. For example, ᚦ (Thorn) for TH, ᛝ (Ing) for NG, or ᛥ (Stān) for ST.

## Punctuation

My system for writing in runes uses three punctuation marks: 

|      Punctuation       | Runic equivalent |
| :--------------------: | :--------------: |
| Space in between words | ᛫                |
|       Comma (,)        | ᛭                |
|    End of sentence     | ᛬                |

I tend to not use consecutive punctuation marks, and remove the space(s) after commas and in between sentences (see the sample below).

Other punctuation marks are removed if not essential, or used as in English.

## Numbers

We have an example of a marginal note in an Old English manuscript (Corpus Christi College, MS 041) using Roman numerals in runes. So I use Roman numerals, with the following runes representing the following letters: 

| Rune | Letter | Value |
| :---: | :---: | :---:|
| ᛁ | I | 1 |
| ᚢ | V | 5 |
| ᛉ | X | 10 |
| ᛚ | L | 50 |
| ᚳ | C | 100 |
| ᛞ | D | 500 |
| ᛗ | M | 1000 |
| ᚾ | N | 0 |

We have lots of examples of Roman numerals in Old English manuscripts in Latin letters. They tended to not use the subtractive method, so 4 was IIII, 9 was VIIII, etc. They tended to surround their numbers with periods (for example, *.iii.* for 3). So I surround my Runic Roman numerals with ᛬. I tend to not omit the spaces around these numbers, like I otherwise do with punctuation.

For larger numbers (greater than 4,000), I separate the numbers into thousands and use a ᛭ in between the groups of thousands (like we use commas in between groups of thousands with our numerals).
